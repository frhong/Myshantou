      <title>Grave-Building in Sangpu Mountains: Clash Between Tradition and Environmental Concerns</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/grave-building-in-sangpu-mountains-clash-between-tradition-and-environmental-concerns.html</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- Done --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Huang Pei’dan &amp;amp; Liang Yaoxiang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half way up the Sang Pu Mountain, the silence in the humid air was broken by a blast of drilling. With a drilling tool that was almost half of his height, a middle-aged straw-hat-wearing man was trying to make a hole in a rock and break it into two. Around him stood another five or six men, each wielding construction tools, either digging into the sand or moving the stones. The area they had cleared was approximately as big as half a tennis court. On one side of it there was already a Chaoshan traditional style grave; on the other, a new one was seemingly under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/04/Grave_Sangpu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Grave building in the Sangpu mountains. Photo: Huang Peidan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such scenes were familiar to the local administrator taking charge of this area. According to Chen Yu, a section member of Tuo Jiang Subdistrict Office and also an MBA student of Shantou University, hundreds of new graves have been built in the Sang Pu mountains over the past few decades, although it was deemed illegal by authorities, and various methods have been used to curb the practice. The mountains, which stretch across the boundaries of Shantou, Chaozhou, and Jieyang, have become a major site of ancestors-worshiping on Qing Ming Festival. However, the building of new graves have also given rise to environmental concerns, as trees near the grave will be clear-cut to make space for the construction. According to Xu Zhenshi, an expert working for Shantou Bureau of Geology, that practice contributes to the threat of landslides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, even when regulations are followed and bodies are cremated rather than buried, graves sometimes are still created, according to a report — by relatives who give the ashes a “second burial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lin, one of the directors of Tuo Jiang Subdistrict Office and in charge of civil affairs, expressed his frustration with the continued construction in protected areas. “Those graves on the Sang Pu mountains are driving us crazy,” said Lin. “Regulations have been made, but whether people will follow them is another story — especially the villagers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nongmin Road, a road between the Sang Pu Mountain and Shantou University, is a narrow track running at the foot of the mountains. As Chen Zhongzhi, a man with a small shack on the road, remembered every Qing Ming Festival, it would be crowded with cars as people visit their ancestors’ graves on the mountain. He has been farming at the foot of the mountain for more than twenty years, and he could quite frequently see people building graves on the mountain. “This whole mountain is available for building graves. If you are a resident of the nearby area, and you find it suitable, you can build a grave here,” said Chen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/04/Grave_Sangpu_2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image: Recently built grave in the Sangpu Shan area. The size of the land area cleared for a common grave is, perhaps, five to ten times that used for graves in cemeteries. Photo: Huang Peidan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building of graves is of particular importance in Chaoshan funeral and interment rituals. An article on the Shantou University Chaoshan Special Collection website explains that building graves is also called Zuo Feng Shui (做风水, literally, making wind-water) in the Chaoshan area. Fengshui is a Chinese philosophical system of people placing structures and building structures in the proper relation to the environment, and it has been widely embraced in Chaoshan area. According to the article, before building a grave, a feng shui master will be hired to decide whether a place has good feng shui, and only after that will they start the building; it is commonly believed that the Sangpu Shan — with high hills, streams, a reservoir at their foot, and breezes reaching in from the coast — have good feng shui. The feng shui status of ancestors’ graves are believed to be able to influence their descendants’ luck, so people planning to build a grave for themselves or their relatives will pay special attention to locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, in a published paper reflecting on these rituals, the author Chen Qishen stated that there is a concept underlying all the funeral and interment rituals — the notion of Ru Tu Wei An (入土为安). In other words, according to Chinese traditions, the deceased can only rest in peace when they are buried in the ground; because of the long tradition of this notion, burial in the ground is prevalent in Shantou. According to statistics shown on the website of Shantou Civil Affairs Bureau, as of 1997, there were about 500,000 graves in Shantou — taking up more than ten square kilometers of land. From 1992 to 1997, 56,800 new graves were built in the city. In 1997, a new regulation requiring cremation came into effect — in part to protect land resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wu Chufen, a resident of Tuopu, says that all of the graves of her ancestors are in the Sang Pu mountains. Most of them have been there since quite a long time ago, but some of them were built in the past decade. “Those lands belong to our village. We can build graves on it if we want to,” said Wu, a women in her fifties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/04/Grave_Sangpu_3-1024x768.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Grave building in the Sangpu hills. Photo: Liang Yaoxiang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wu’s statement contradicts official regulations. In 1997, the Shantou government issued a control regulation on funeral and interment, and it was later revised in 2004. The regulation stipulated that all dead bodies have to be cremated, and burial in the ground is strictly prohibited. Five years after the regulation’s implementation, according to a report published in the Nanfang Daily, the cremation rate in Shantou had risen drastically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the rise of the cremation rate may not necessarily result in the fading of burial in the ground, as was pointed out by the Xinhua reporter Xiao Sisi. In her article “Second Time Burial in the Ground in the Countryside,” she mentioned that it was still common for people in Shantou to build graves and bury the ashes of the deceased into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An announcement made by the Shantou Civil Affairs Bureau in 2001 specifically mentioned the act of Hui Lin Zao Fen, namely to destroy a patch of forest to build graves. It was said to be “strictly prohibited,” and the graves will be demolished and removed once they are found out. According to Chen Yu, the section member of Tuo Jiang subdistrict office, the Sangpu mountains are publicly owned land. Therefore, it is not allowed to build any permanent structures, including graves, on it, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect the mountain from being damaged by the building of graves, a group of administrative law enforcement officials called the “Detachment of Funeral and Interment Reform” will go on patrol on the mountain twice a week. If any grave-building is discovered by these officials, the offenders will be stopped and asked to replant trees, said Mr. Lin, the Subdistrict Office director. In addition to that, the whole mountain area has been divided into different divisions, each administered by different neighborhood committees; these committees are responsible for hiring people to patrol in their divisions everyday to ensure that no new graves are being built, according to Mr. Lin. What’s more, according to Xu Zhenshi, the geography expert working for the Land Use Management Section of Shantou Bureau of Geology, the Bureau of Geology of Guangdong Province will take aerial photo of the whole province twice a year, and these photos will be used to spot illegal uses of land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, doubts exist over whether those regulations and enforcement of them work effectively in practice. “Those leaders are also locals, how could they possibly remove the others’ ancestors’ graves? Even they themselves want their ancestors to be buried in graves on the mountain,”said Lin Jun, a student of Shantou University Medical College and also a resident of Tuopu who has a long-standing interest in the graves in the Sangpu mountains. “To be honest, there are only two types of people will be buried in a cemetery: the Christian and the poor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of historical factors complicate who controls land like the Sangpu Shan area, and how the land there is used. According to Chen Yu, the local official, the ownership of the land on the Sang Pu Mountain was quite blurry in the past. Many of the villagers thought that the lands belonged to their villages, and therefore it was perfectly reasonable for them to build graves on the mountain. What’s more, the long history of this practice was also thought to be able to justify the practice itself. “We have been doing that for hundreds of years. All of our ancestors are buried on the mountain. Now, how could you say those are publicly owned lands — and then stop us from doing that any more?” said Wu Chufen, the Tuopu village resident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/04/Grave_Sangpu_4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of graves under construction with cut trees in the middle background. In the far background, construction of Guangdong Technion is underway. Photo: Liang Yaoxiang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of danger posed by the practice of destroying forests to build could be seen by many, including the local officials overseeing this area. Xu Zhenshi, the geography expert pointed to the danger of landslides. “It could cause the potential threat of landslides, that’s for sure,” said Xu. “And what’s more, I could totally see the Sangpu mountains becoming covered with graves if things continue to go like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanguo Shopping Mall Closes, MIXC Under Construction</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/nanguo-shopping-mall-closes-mixc-under-construction.html</link>
      <description>&lt;!--Done --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Wal-Mart of Nanguo Shopping Mall, carts were filled with commodities. But they were being pushed towards the warehouse instead of the checkout counters, and by staff instead of customers. A bulletin posted at the entrance of the store illustrated what was happening, “Wal-Mart will close on the expiration date of its contract — December 7th, 2015.” Several days before its official closure, most goods were unavailable at the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015/12/nanguo-mall-inside.png&quot; alt=&quot;The staff was taking an account of inventory and removing it from the shelves. Photo: Well Tan&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the closure of the Wal-Mart, Nanguo Shopping Mall, which has been in Shantou for 15 years, is about to end its mission. China Resources Land Limited, a development company, spent 1.57 billion RMB on the land and is going to build a new urban complex, MIXC, on the original site to replace Nanguo Shopping Mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nanguo Shopping Mall was the first modern shopping center in Shantou, as well as the biggest one in eastern Guangdong Province. It opened in 2000 and introduced a number of well-known shops such as Wal-Mart, Parkson, Mc Donald’a and KFC. In the past fifteen years, Nanguo Shopping Mall has been one of the busiest and most popular leisure site in Shantou; over a thousand performances and activities were held in it, according to E-Jing Net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, China Resources Land Limited (CRL) made an agreement with the Shantou government to tear down Nanguo Shopping Mall in order to build a new MIXC. CRL, a Hong Kong property developer whose business covers over 20 cities in China, builds complexes offering residences, offices, shopping and entertainment in one location. In Shenzhen, the MIXC is located in a busy district, Luohu district, near Diwang Mansion, one of the most famous landmarks in Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Wal-Mart re-open in the new complex? “Nothing has been decided yet,” said Huang Sanshan, the manager of Cost Control Department of Shantou Huarun Estate Development Co., Ltd, the Shantou branch of CRL. But according to THEMIXC.COM, MIXC has its own supermarket brand — Ole’ Supermarket, which specializes in the imported goods. Up to 2014, thirty Ole’ Supermarkets have been open in different MIXCs respectively, according to Ole’ online shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 28th, 2014, CRL made a 1.57 billion yuan deal with the Shantou Municipal Bureau of Urban and Rural Planning to turn the former Nanguo center and area adjacent to it into the new development. The total area of the land is .11 square kilometers according to No.019 Construction Land Use Permit issued by the bureau, roughly one city block of downtown Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June of 2014, CRL took over the land and property management of Nanguo Shopping Mall and asked shopkeepers, who had no long-term contracts with the mall, to move out before September 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 15th, 2014, CRL started to lay the cornerstones at the area behind Nanguo Shopping Mall, which was their first step to rebuild this area, according to Shantou government official website. At the same time, several parts of Nanguo Shopping Mall were surrounded with scaffolds and prepared to be dismantled, such as the well-known landmark — the blue ball at the top of the mall.At the end of last year, most shopkeepers had moved out. Only stores who had signed a long-term contract with the former shopping mall manager remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May, 2015, KFC and Parkson moved out. And soon on December 7th, 2015, Wal-Mart is going to leave. Only Music Online KTV and Yifan Cinema still stay in Nanguo Shopping Mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When will the last two stores leave? There are no exact dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff of Yifan Cinema, Yao Xun, said, “There are still eight years left on the contract, and we have not been informed the exact date of leaving by CRL yet.” Yifan Cinema and CRL are in the process of negotiation, according to Yao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another remainder is Music Online KTV. The receptionist of the KTV, Guo Ni, said, “At the beginning of November, the staff of CRL came here and measured the usable area of the KTV for some purposes, but my boss did not tell us any information about leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many Shantou citizens born in 1990s, Nanguo Shopping Mall was regarded as one of the most meaningful landmarks in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhao Xiaoyun, a high school student, said, “I often browsed here and purchased some necessities in Wal-Mart. Nanguo Shopping Mall is somehow like a precious memory to me, but I am also looking forward to the MIXC.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIXC is expected to open in 2018, according to the CRL. Shantou government assumed that the new MIXC will contribute approximately 250 million yuan for taxation and provide over 5,000 jobss, according to its official website. Xu Kai, the vice mayor in Shantou, said in the cornerstone laying ceremony, “MIXC is of great importance for Shantou to enhance the development of a modern service industry as well as to promote the city quality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more popular level, some waxed nostalgic about the departure of the old Nanguo shopping center.
A Chaoshan rapper, Wang Wei composed a piece of music and made a music video to commemorate the period people spent in Nanguo Shopping Mall. The lyrics went along with a steady beat, “When I walk along Jinhuan and Changping roads, I have a look at Nanguo Shopping Mall several times. Before long, it will become our memory, and disappear from our life……”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guangdong-Technion Ceremony Takes Place, “Silicon Valley of south China” and “Israel Town” Planned for Northwest Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/israel_town_shantou_guandong_technion.html</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/Shantou-University-Tech-College_1_Myshantou.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Shimon Peres, 92-year-old former Prime Minister of Israel, left of center space between cornerstones, and 87-year-old Li Ka Shing, right of center space between cornerstones, and a number of Chinese officials and Israeli administrators symbolically shovel dirt at the Guangdong-Technion construction site to launch the project.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guangdong-Technion cornerstone laying ceremony and a forum on the future of education took place at Shantou University on Wednesday at the construction site of the new institution and at the newly opened Shantou University Sports Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Prime Minister of Israel Shimon Peres, STU billionaire benefactor Li Ka Shing, Technion administrators and local and provincial officials gathered for the ceremony. Li, Peres, and many of the Technion guests expressed a similar vision for the new university and its potential effect on the region: They emphasized the power of science to innovate, to overcome political differences, and to provide for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli administrators and Chinese officials connected to the event talked about their hopes for a “Silicon Valley of south China” based around Guangdong-Technion. The new university is part of a larger plan to transform Tuopu and the northwest area of Shantou into one with a significant Israeli presence: a larger Technion site is planned across Daxue Lu, and creative and industrial parks are planned near that site. An “Israel Town” is also planned for Israeli faculty and families to live in, and as a tourist destination, the “exotic and Western lifestyle” of which “will make Chinese people feel like being in a foreign country,” according to a Longhu district government website. At the end of the morning’s ceremony, Shantou and Haifa — Technion-Israel’s home city — officials signed a twin city agreement and a number of business deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/Shantou_Uni_Tech_Map.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A map of the planned transformation of land adjacent to Tuopu and in the northwest Shantou region, which would turn the area into one with a heavy Israeli presence. An “Israel Town” (marked as “Israeli Village” here) is planned for Israeli faculty and families and as a tourist destination in Shantou, in an area immediately northwest of the Queshi Bridge and across from the “Xiao Gongyuan” historic section of the city.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first speakers at the ceremony, Technion-Israel’s President Peretz Lavie, said he was honored to lay the cornerstone of Guangdong-Technion, an institution “born of a partnership between two great and ancient nations; inspired by the noble pursuit of knowledge, wisdom and discovery; dedicated to education, research and innovation; established for the benefit of the people of China, Israel and all humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Prime Minister Peres, Li Ka Shing, and Hu Chunhua, party secretary of Guangdong province, then put a time capsule in the Technion cornerstone. They placed a scroll, with images of Shantou University with a completed Technion, and the contents of Lavie’s speech, and a small drone — included to represent the technology of the time and because of Li’s personal interest in drones — into the capsule. No specific time for opening the capsule has been set, according to Yu Shanyan, the minister of the Propaganda Department of Shantou University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Chinese officials and Israeli administrators — including the 87-year-old Li and the 92-year-old Peres — then picked up shovels and threw dirt on the base of the cornerstone, symbolizing the start of Technion’s construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/Shantou-Construction-Site.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The first phase of the Guangdong-Technion. The site lies south of East Gate, and in between the Sangpu hills and the new Shantou University Sports Park. Photo: John Noonan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While construction of the new facility may take several years, according to planners, Technion faculty, students and classes will begin in fall of 2016, the institution’s new leader, Li Jiange, said, with 200 students; Technion’s language of instruction will be English. Aaron Ciechanover, the Israeli vice-chancellor of Guangdong-Technion, said that two majors will be available for those students, chemical engineering and bio-ecology; the next majors after these will be material and environmental science. Classes will be held at STU’s former administration building, which finished renovations in June of 2015 to provide Technion a temporary space. That building is able to accommodate 400 students, until the new university’s facilities are ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, majors will be added each year, and by 2025, three departments offering ten majors in total will be recruiting students, according to the Guangdong-Technion website.The final enrollment will be 5,060, including 4,060 undergraduates and 1,000 postgraduates, the same document said. Construction on the larger “southern” Guangdong-Technion site across Daxue Lu will begin in July 2016 and finish in 2017, according to the Southcn.net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As officials and guests entered Shantou University Sports Park arena from the cornerstone ceremony, a video graphic of a golden phoenix took flight at the center stage screen, from forested green video hills. It circuited the 360 degree screen surrounding the top of the auditorium. As it flew, historical and modern images of Shantou and the Chaoshan region appeared in its wake. It finished its flight on center screen again — though this time, the hills had been transformed into an image of a completed Guangdong Techion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/Shimon.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Shimon Peres, left, and Peretz Lavie, right, speak at an afternoon session on technology and the future of education in the new sports park arena. The arena features a front stage wide screen video screen and the top of the arena features a 360 degree video screen. Photo: John Noonan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speakers, including Peres, Li, Chinese officials, and Israeli-Technion administrators, then took the stage one by one. They all spoke of the significance of the new university, and the power of science, technology, and education. Ofir Akunis, Israel’s Minister of Science, Technology and Space, called the building of Technion, “a milestone, and the biggest one in the history of China-Israel relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peres, a 1994 Nobel Peace Prize winner for efforts at peace between Palestine and Israel, said the world was leaving an “age of territory,” in which one tried to gain land and money to create wealth, and entering a more advanced stage — one in which it was possible to gain through mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are entering a new age, the age of science,” Peres said, where “you can become strong without making anybody weaker.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence and conflict continues in the world, Peres said, because of mankind’s inability to completely leave behind the ideas of “the age of territory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a forum later in the day, Peres expressed a similar idea, but one that combined Israel’s long history with its desire for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Moses had the first start-up,” he said. “Don’t be a prisoner to the old way of doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciechanover, Guangdong-Technion’s vice chancellor, told an anecdote intended to display the power of science to transcend political differences: He’d met an Iranian scientist at a conference who had taken a package of a cancer treatment drug out and said “We use this everywhere in Iran.” The drug had been developed and produced in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/Lee.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Li Ka Shing, billionaire and STU benefactor, bows onstage before speaking to a standing ovation from much of the crowd. Photo: John Noonan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While polite applause from the crowd greeted each speaker, the crowd roared when Li Ka Shing, constantly wearing an enthusiastic grin, took the stage, to a student orchestra playing the overture theme song from “Star Wars.” Li spoke in an almost poetic fashion about his commitment to Shantou University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I am weary and feeling worn, when I am gloomy and feeling torn, I think of Shantou University; herein lies my heart — forever sealed and cast in its halls of learning,” Li said. “This barren land has become a field of dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li went on to speak of the hurdles that had to be overcome in undertaking new ventures in a system beset with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Driving reforms in education through a dense forest of ideology could be a most harrowing and lonesome venture — toiling through thick and thin. But out of difficulties grew miracles — and this is an awesome one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the ceremony, six people, comprised of Guangdong province and Shantou city officials, Israeli-Technion administators, and former foreign affairs minister of China Li Zhaoxing put their hands on a “launching ball” — a ball of ceramic or glass commonly used at the start of new businesses or enterprises in China — to launch the “China-Israel Cooperation Zone for Scitech Innovation in Shantou,” the official name for Guangdong-Technion and all its related elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/Israeli-and-Chinese-officials.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Israeli and Chinese officials — including China’s former foreign affairs minister Li Zhaoxing, second from right, light up the high-tech “launching ball” to officially undertake the Israeli-Chinese cooperation project. Photo form Baidu Image.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike more traditional launching balls, however, when the officials put their hands on this one, it lit up internally in a high-tech display, and revealed a word to signify the undertaking of the enterprise: “Inauguration,” it read.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Craftsmen of Xiao Gong Yuan (Little Garden)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Xiaogongyuan (小公园), the “Little Park”, built in 1930s, is an important cultural and historical area of Shantou. The district had a seven-floor department store, more than 100 stores, and several foreign consulates in its heyday. The prosperous place also attracted many craftsmen to make a living there; it was full of artisans and hands-on laborers in the past — those who mend umbrellas, shoes, razors and many others. As time went by Xiaogongyuan became more and more decrepit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renovation plans for the area have fallen into a start-stop-restart cycle in the last decade due to insufficient funds from investors. Nowadays, more and more old vocations are vanishing as Shantou modernizes. Perhaps the craftsmen pictured here will be the last people to practice their craftsmanship in traditional ways on the “Little Park” street corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a corner in the area, 17 Minzu Street, Gao Banxiong, a 69-year-old-man, is making needles for knitting. He previously worked in a soy sauce factory. Making needles is a second career for him. He earns about 500 RMB, roughly $80 U.S., per month from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The needles are made from bamboo. Gao uses a machine to cut bamboo into bamboo sticks at home. Then he takes a last step — putting the stick on sand paper, rubbing it for 30 seconds, which makes the top of the stick thin enough for knitting. He has sanded needles for 46 years since he began helping his father with his needle business in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aunt Huang is a regular at Gao’s needle sharpening shop. She often takes the bus to Xiaogongyuan just for his needles. She buys needles to knit clothes for her grandchildren. “His needles are smoother than the machine-made needles, which makes knitting smoother,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, few people continue this practice because it earns so little and demand is slight. Gao’s children do not want to pursue their father’s craft. “I have nothing to do but making needles. I enjoy it and I want to keep doing this until I die,” he says, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a stall on Wansheng Street, busy and lively. Many people go there, most of them are regulars. Ji Yanxian is a 52-year-old cobbler and his daily life is mending shoes, drinking tea with friends, talking and joking. His grandfather, father, uncles, and brothers used to be cobblers. But he is now the last remaining cobbler in his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ji has been a cobbler for 38 years since he was 14 years old. He is confident in his skill, low price and high speed. “Only if the shoes you mend are done well will your customers trust you,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Zhang is a 66-year-old barber with 55 years of experience who works in his home. An old mirror, an old chair, and some old tools are like old friends. He has used these to make money for many years, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of his old customers still come here now. “I have got my haircut here for over 10 years and I trust Zhang,” a customer says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the “Little Park” literally crumbles around them, these traditional craftsmen continue their hands-on work — as long as their hands will let them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creative Park 1860 Opens</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/creative-park-1860-opens.html</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- Done --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Daisy (Jialing Xie) and Yvonneva (Qixin Li)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of flags flapping on the both sides of Xidi Road, cars and motorcycles parked in front of four brick walls scrawled with 1,8,6,0 on each wall: After nearly 11 months of construction, the first cultural creative park in eastern Guangdong — Shantou 1860 Creative Park — opened to the public on 12 Oct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening ceremony of the park was accompanied by the first cultural creative festival in eastern Guangdong, its theme being “潮文化·创意潮”, referring to both “Chaoshan culture” and “wave of creativity.” (潮 can represent both “Chaoshan” and “tendency” or “wave” in Chinese.) “1860” refers to the year that Shantou and a number of other ports around China were forcibly opened to foreign trade following the Second Opium War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/DSC_0808-1024x687.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Creative Park - Shantou 1860&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Park 1860 is located on the edge of Xiao Gongyuan, the Little Park, Shantou’s old historical section, and near Haibin Lu, Shantou’s harbor-side road, which is also currently under construction to create a revitalized seaside area and marina. While plans for the renovation and development of Xiao Gongyuan have existed for years, “1860” is the first tangible evidence of creative development in the city’s old section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the president of the park, Jinsong Lin, nearly 1000 people visited the park in the opening day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There were more than 500 visitors in the morning, which is predictable,” Lin said, “What makes me proud is that I can say it is definitely a grand occasion in the Chaoshan area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/old-man-walks-pass-the-100-Strangers-720x340.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A man walks by an exhibition entitled “100 Strangers.” Photo by: Daisy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creative park was developed with funds from the East Guangdong Overseas Chinese EXPO and and Jinping district’s cultural industrial development project funds, as well as funds from private investment companies, according to local media reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou No. 9 Middle School, a long-standing, large school, serves as the location of the creative studio complex. The structure and color of old buildings have been kept. Evacuation notices are still stuck on shabby doors. Blackboards, desks and chairs have been preserved — but a largely glass-walled museum dominates the center of the park. The idea of preserving the old instead of eradicating it in favor of the new pleased some visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have been to the 798 Creative Park in Beijing. Though “1860” is not in the same category as 798 — whether in scale and or quality of exhibitions — the idea of renovating an old school and turning it into a park is better than 798’s. That park was transformed from an old factory,” visitor Meisi Chen said, as she sat on a bench with her husband asking their son to help take a photo. “These desks and chairs are like what I had in school 20 years ago, reminding me of the old days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festival associated with the park’s opening will provide visitors with a series of lectures, a ballet performance of “Sleeping Beauty” from the National Corps de Ballet of Russia, a national-level painting and photography exhibition, and crafts that are related to local culture like Chaoshan embroidery, overseas Chaoshan letters, and T-shirts painted in characters representing Chaoshan dialect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the exhibition, other activities like an exhibition on animation, music salon, writing, graffiti, and photography contest about the old town will be held in the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weiliang Lin, who teaches flute in Shantou University and was visiting the park, said that the value of the site lay in its sense of history — and for being real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The park is so special because it was transformed from an old school in the old town. It is much better to make good use of it than build a fake one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myshantou.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0787-687x1024.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/DSC_0787-687x1024-687x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A woman who’s job is collecting garbage at “1860” with her kids. Photo by: Daisy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Lin said that the responsibility of those running the park was not only to provide people with cultural exhibitions, but also to raise awareness of preserving and stimulating the local culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an exhibition called “16 Children” (十六奴仔 in Chaoshan dialect), all the items on display were created by local young people from college students to artists. Dada — a local teacher, fashion designer, and event planner known locally by his nickname — who was instrumental in planning the exhibition, felt satisfied with what they had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is meaningful to receive appreciation from visitors, as well as to work with people that have same goal as you,” Dada said, “Now, we can tell the local people that what they can see in an exhibition is much more than painting and calligraphy.” “16 Children” will extend its run due for an additional week, due to its popularity with visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitor Simin Chen, a local studying in Guangzhou, said that recognition of customs and history among Shantou youth was inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I prefer the traditional atmosphere here to modern Guangzhou,” Chen said, “Now since there are lots of teenagers who have the aspiration of developing Shantou, I want to work here and devote myself to my hometown too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/04/garbagewoman-with-her-kid-visits-the-1860-park.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some visitors wondered and worried whether the city had the climate to support such an endeavor in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to make it a good creative park in Shantou, as it does not have a strong artistic atmosphere, famous artists or excellent exhibitions here,” said Huang Zixuan, a Shantou University art school student said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Matsu, Goddess of the Sea, and her Island Shrine</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/matsu-goddess-of-the-sea-and-her-island-shrine.html</link>

&lt;p&gt;The woman sang and raised her arms while walking around in a circle outside the temple. In front of her was a small altar with plates of fruits and meat on it. No one could understand her words. People stopped and stared, then went upstairs and went into the entrance of the temple. The woman was not just worshiping but actually being taken over by her object of worship: Matsu, goddess of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She is possessed by a god”, Xu Yunxin, 60, chief director of Council of Tianhou Temple said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/02/Matsu4-Worshipping-Woman.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matsu-Worshipping Woman&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked in the temple council since 2006, Xu has met many people like the unknown woman. Xu said that the worshipping woman was not unique; followers of Matsu come and visit their god regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deity the woman had come for is Matsu, a goddess who protects people who live on the coastal areas of China from the disasters of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to legend, Matsu is an indigenous goddess of the sea who protects fishermen and sailors associated with the ocean. With her mortal name “Lin Moniang”, Matsu was born without crying and thus got a given name – “moniang” – which means “Silent Girl.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories surround Lin Moniang and her transformation into the goddess Matsu. Moniang’s father and brother were both fishermen. One day, a terrible storm attacked them as they went out to fish. Moniang and her mother were staying at home and praying for the two at sea. Suddenly Moniang fell into a trance and saw her drowning father and brother in the dream. Her mother woke her up without noticing she was diverting Moniang’s attention, causing the death of her son. However, her father returned alive miraculously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, the legend of Lin Moniang transformed into stories of the goddess Matsu. “Ma” here didn’t mean mother but grandmother in Chinese. “Tsu” meant ancestor. People put “Ma” and “Tsu” together ,regarding it as a deferential form of address to women advanced in years and highly esteemed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, coastal residents in China living a traditional sea-faring life worship the sea goddess as a deity who can help those at sea and living near the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a small land lying at the mouth of the Hanjiang River in the sea off Shantou coast, there is an island called Mayu; its main village has only about 1000 residents, but they are all followers of Matsu. The small island has eight temples devoted to sea gods. Among them the biggest temple, Tianhou, is devoted to Matsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Villagers like the woman full of the spirit of Matsu can worship in ways as simple as what they usually eat. Fish, pork and fruits like apples are often put on the altar, behind which is a 1.5-meter-high clothed statues of Mastu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents come to the Matsu temple to pray on the first and the fifteen day of every lunar month. Also on March 23 and September 9, which are the birthday of Matsu and the day she went back to the heaven, more people will come to the small temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/02/Matsu3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matsu3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believers who come to the temple are mainly from Chaoyang, Chenghai, Puning and Chao’an. These Shantou districts form the biggest group of Matsu followers. However, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are also a big population believing in Matsu, especially those from Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lying on the mountainside, the main temple has several shrines that stretch out on the mountainside below it. Before the entrance of the temple is an incense burner where “ghost money” can be burned for the deceased. The complex roofs are constructed in a traditional Chinese style and include numerous wood carvings, including dragons, lions, as well as sculptures of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ke Kaiping, one of the four members of the Council of Tianhou Temple, emphasized the role played by the maritime trade in developing the Chaoshan area as a center of business. Over the past hundreds of years, as Chaoshan people went overseas, they paid tribute to Matsu. One of the things they must do before departure was to go to the temple and visit Matsu, only after which they could take a big wooden boat and leave. “Matsu is in charge of the sea. They wanted safety through their voyage in the boundless ocean,” Ke said with his arms stretching and made a wide circle. He added that every year when those believers come back, they will come to the temple and show their thanks and respect to Matsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a history of more than 800 years, Tianhou Temple has been reconstructed countless times. With all religious activities banned during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Matsu culture here also suffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalling those period of time, Xu Wenxin said the Red Guard threw the Matsu statue into the sea. They had to put the destroyed temple to use keeping pigs. After the Cultural Revolution, the devoted villagers raised funds to rebuild the temple. It soon got generous support from many oversesas Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a monument hanging in front of the building, Tianhou Temple is named a cultural relic by the Shantou government. But some believed it was support in name only. “The government didn’t help us at all!” Xu Yunxin said in a big voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/02/Matsu2-Ancient-Buildings-on-Mayu-Island.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matsu2-Ancient Buildings on Mayu Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen Zhanshan, a professor of Shantou University specializing in Chaoshan culture study, said that from ancient time to present, Chaoshan people have been earning a life by fishing and trading over the sea. “It’s so natural that they need the blessing from the god of the sea,” Chen Zhanshan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that the culture in Chaoshan area is complicated, with different combinations of culture and belief from other religions. Matsu may have a connection with Buddhism, or Lao Tzu, or even Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in Mayu village lead a quiet life of farming work. Ke Kaiping said they have harmony and comfort in their minds, though the place they live in is an isolated small island due to their beliefs. “The whole village worships Matsu and she will protect us forever,” Ke Kaiping said with a big smile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unique Chaoshan Centipede Dance Creeping Along Despite Woes</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/unique-chaoshan-centipede-dance-creeping-along-despite-woes.html</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- Done --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Catherine Lee and Zhang Xiaodan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://v.qq.com/txp/iframe/player.html?vid=f030892e0w2&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man leads the centipede with a golden ball, like a conductor directing an orchestra. Wherever the ball moves, a twenty-two meter long centipede starts to dance. Raising its sharp head, twisting and moving its flexible body forward rapidly, the lifelike myriapod seems as vivid as the real one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originating in Ximen town, Centipede Dance is the most famous dance among those special dances in Chenghai district, Shantou, namely Double Dragon Dance and Lobster Dance, which are dubbed by local people as “The aero-amphibious dances”. The Centipede Dance applied for the National Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2004, then finally successfully selected into it in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twenty-two-meter long “Centipede”, is made by iron, bamboo and cloth, composed of twelve sections. In the traditional scale, each articular sclerate needs at least five people to hold and manipulate. Besides, there is a group of participants playing gongs and drums. Normally speaking, totally more than a hundred participants needed each time in tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centipede is  the star of a traditional dance, the Centipede Dance, only performed on special days. 16th, February every leap year is one of the biggest ceremonies. When the traditional “Divinities Contest” is held, the “centipede” will parade along the main street of the town. Whenever and wherever it appears, there will be a big crowd yelling and cheering excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centipede dance is similar to lion dances performed at Chinese festivals. However, the lion dance only requires two people where the centipede dance requires at least a hundred people to be performed. Unlike the lion dance, the centipede dance is representative of Chaoshan culture. But this unique dance is in jeopardy because of lack of interest among the younger generation and the high costs associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupendously, it costs two hundred thousand RMB (about twenty nine thousand US dollars) per time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need thirty thousand RMB to make a centipede, not accounting for more than one hundred people’s salary.” Said Chen Xishun, 58-year-old. He is the fifth generation successor of Centipede Dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen Xishun mentioned that the expensive fee restricts the development of Centipede Dance. Before selected into the National Intangible Cultural Heritage, performances of Centipede Dance depends on villagers’ donation. But luckier than other dance forms, Centipede Dance is now supported by government after successfully selected into the National Intangible Cultural Heritage. Therefore, the dance form can be carried on. However, the financial aid rescues the dying dance form but it’s still far way from carrying forward the tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cai Zhuoqiang, the officer of Ximen town propaganda department said: “Government’s routine financial aid is not enough to carry on such a big custom. We’re now applying for another financial aid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy of national culture department tends to support the countryside. Traditional culture or customs like Centipede Dance, which exists in the middle-scale town, is not highly protected. In addition, financial aid is hard to apply according to Cai zhuoqiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, despite the financial support, holding a Centipede Dance performance still meets difficulties. The obvious one is lacking new performers willing to devote their time to the craft. As the amateur team, participants mainly are local people. It’s not easy to find enough people for a performance, so teams even recruit children to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My little kid needs to be the drummer,” Chen Xishun said. Costing huge expense of money and human resource, that’s why normally the dance is performed every four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, another common way to protect a culture is to teach the next generation whoever wants to learn. However, Chen Xishun has his own opinion to protect Centipede Dance. Actually, he is strongly against teaching Centipede Dance skills to youth from other places even other districts of Shantou city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those who teach it to people in other place are traitors!” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having no plan to teach the next generation, Chen Xishun prefers to let whoever wants to play to join in the Centipede Dance performance. Speaking about who will be the nest successor, he laughed and said: “It’s just a pattern. Who plays well who is the next successor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Centipede Dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2009/05/centipede_dance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Myshantou - the centipede dance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centipede dance, which is long about twenty-second meters. It is separated for three parts: head, body and tail. The head of the centipede looks like the lion’s head. There is a pair of sharp teeth in both sides of the mouth. Its body is combined by twenty-eight hard and soft clothes, which makes it to move flexibly. And some lamps and candles and fireworks equipment are hung inside its body. The tail is in the shape of scissors. When the Centipede Dance begins to show, one person holds a colorful ball leading way and fifteen persons hiding in the abdomen of the centipede. The fifteen men should stoop and bend the knees and they must use “Ding zi Ma”, “bow step”, “Guan yin zuo lian” (different kinds of horse stances) and other martial art actions to control the big centipede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weight of the centipede is over 100 kg, so it demands the performers should have the basic of martial art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centipede dance is one of the excellent dances in Chenghai district. It has a long history, which more than 100 years. And now it’s a famed folk consummate art in Chenghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for a centipede dance came from two Chenghai residents in Qing dynasty who saw a centipede creeping and decided it would make a good dance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&quot;Province Towns&quot; Separate Migrants from Shantou People</title>

&lt;p&gt;Ten o’clock is the busiest time for the old market in Tuopu every day, when you should speak loudly in order to make yourself be heard in two meters. It’s very hard to know what others are saying in this place where crowds of people are selling and bargaining. However that’s just for the left side where local residents live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the right side which is not near the busy road, it is so silent that everything seems still in a deep sleep, an anomaly in a country where boisterous street life is the norm. Most residents in the right side are migrant workers from Anhui, Guizhou and Jiangxi who go to work at five o’clock in the morning and come home late in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This place is almost empty at the daytime. It’s hard to find a person to talk to,” said Zhang Lixia, an Anhui woman who resided in the right side of this Old Market in Tuopu for at least four years.”We don’t like blending with local people. Also, though there are many migrant workers in this small place. Often those from the same province live together,” added Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/justaslice/3045174242/in/photolist-5D6jdb-fdbAAy-5CYmgu-9qRaGo-8jDLwm-8qvfjQ-8ur37b-9qRaGw-8qs78i-8iQM2r-9qRaGq-8ur373-9xXEky-5Shsy-5ShqQ-5Sgg3-5SgpP-5Sgvv-5Shwb-5Sh85-5SheW-5UZ66-5Shmw-5Sgqy-5SgAZ-5Sgp2-5Sgrn-5Shaz-5Sgv3-5Sh6h-5ShkH-5Shtj-5SgPD-5ShoX-5Sgyp-5ShnY-5ShtX-5ShuQ-5Sh9h-5Shce-5ShfD-5Shq2-5Shjk-5SgzQ-9iThEf-5UZ65-5ShrV-5SgwM-5Sgo8-83qxaY&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/02/3045174242_5a6789eea5_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;town-province&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhang’s neighborhood in Tuopu could be called “Anhui town,” due to the high number of Anhui residents who live there. Similar to Chinatowns in foreign countries, migrant workers like Zhang often live in “province towns,” areas of the city where they live with relatives or people from the same province. They use their own dialect not standard Chinese, play and eat with people from the same province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though living in Shantou, the gap between them and the mainstream society is large. Like Robinson Crusoe, in Shantou those migrant workers are isolated in island-like neighborhoods, a phenomenon rooted in the government’s policies, the local people’s bias and by different culture or custom. What’s more, migrants themselves make the separation stronger by sticking to their “province towns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrants’ lives rely entirely on people from the same province. “We were introduced to Shantou by fellow villagers ten years ago, and our life here also depends on them,” said Zhang. Struggling for more than ten years in Shantou, Zhang and her husband owned a big shop (more than 100) to do wholesale business. They bought goods from Yiwu, Guangzhou and Jieyang. Most of their goods were sold to fellow villagers and Jiangxi people, who setting up a temporary stall with goods spread out on the ground for sale in downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrants’ lives have little connection with local ones. “We do not mix much with the local people and we don’t like to mix with them so much,” Zhang said when she was helping a fellow villager to take care of his two kids on a sunny weekend. Those kids were studying in Jinleyuan Primary School with local kids. They played with the local classmates in school and when they back home they just played with kids from Anhui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more than 150,000 migrant workers in Shantou, according to the Shantou government website. According to Shantou Special Economic Zone Evening, Huang Bingzhang, a representative of NPC in Shantou, said migrant workers were crowded in “City Villages” – under-developed areas of the city, resembling villages – and had a hard life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiaogongyuan, Xidong, Jinlongcun and Longhucun were these kind of “City Villages” in Shantou where there are many “province towns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language was a big problem, which contributed to separate migrants from local ones. “Some time we want to talk to the local people, but it’s very hard to understand what they are saying,” said Wang, a 60 year old Guizhou woman who had been Shantou for 3 years. Chao Shan dialect to them is just like French to Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bias of local people to migrants also made the “province towns” emerged. “The local people always look down upon us migrant workers. Working for the same restaurant, I do more work than local one, but only get 500-600yuan every month. That’s quite less than local one,” said Cai Lanxia, a 43 year old Anhui woman lived in Xiaogongyuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low social status and a lack of respect upsets migrants who live with locals. “I have only a few local friends and they treat me not bad. Nevertheless, I always feel my status is lower than the locals,” said Mr. Zhou, a 46 year Henan man lived in Xiaogongyuan who earned 500-600 yuan per month by transporting goods with tricycle. He didn’t like to be a marginal man in this city. But for his kids to have good education and his family to have better life, he said he had to stay here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many local people thought they did not discriminate these outsiders, however most of them did not ever meet or talk with migrants. Even those local people who lived with migrants for years didn’t familiar with their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Migrant workers’ lives are quite mysterious to me. I just know my neighbors are from Anhui and Guizhou, but I haven’t got a chance to talk with them in more than one year,” said a local woman lived in Tuopu near Guizhou town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is better in Shantou, according to many migrants in the “province towns.” However many migrants didn’t want to get the residence permit because that would mean losing their right to land ownership in their home province. “We make more money by doing business in Shantou than staying in Anhui on the farm. We don’t plan to register in Shantou to be a local residence, though it saves us 1400 yuan every year for kids’ education.” said Zhang, living a quite success life in Anhui town in Tuopu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhang said in the near future, they would say goodbye to their successful business in Shantou and back home to be farmers again. “Shantou is a more developed city, but no matter how beautiful it is, it’s not our hometown,” Zhang added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&quot;Cold Violence&quot; Comes out of the Home, into Public Discussion</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/cold-violence-comes-out-of-the-home-into-public-discussion.html</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- Done --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Shirley Xue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to domestic abuse, a common image is someone beaten with blood running on the body comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, have you ever suffered or seen this in a marriage: After quarreling, the couple didn’t speak to each other for more than one month; Sleeping on the same bed, but no sexual life for several months; No beating, but one threatens the other; One controls the money of the family, and only gives the other little money (maybe even not enough for eating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more than a simple conflict between a couple, it is a new kind of home violence-cold violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cold violence is on the increase. It’s more often to occur in white collars families,” said Chen Chun, the director of Legal Aid Center of Chenghai,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen, in her late thirties, is a female lawyer in Shantou who has helped dozens of women to deal with home violence in her 15 year career as an attorney. The Legal Aid Center for which she works, a low cost legal aid service, has received more than 100 cases in total; 70% of which are concerned with women who have suffered domestic abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen, a graduate of Zhongshan University, passed up opportunities to work in Shenzhen and Guangzhou to champion causes of social justice in Shantou. She has worked to provide safe places to stay for women – many of whom are migrants married to local men – who face domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pexels.com/photo/bench-nature-love-people-50592/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2009/05/couple-cold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cold violence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen says that cold violence can do as much damage – or more – than physical abuse because it is not punishable by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cold violence is much more horrible than physical abuse in the marriage,” added Chen. “Not telling the bad things of your marriage to others is no longer suitable for today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to China Daily, Hou Zhiming, director of the Maple Women’s Psychological Counseling Center (a nonprofit organization based in Beijing) said rather than physical, cold violence was psychological abuse which involved such things as verbal attacks, disregarding a partner’s views or imposing economic controls on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the popular theory of marriage law in China, there are three kind of violence in marriage-physical abuse, sexual violence and cold violence. Cold violence is the update version of domestic violence, which can lead people to feel anxious, depressive and even kill themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “cold violence” has emerged over the past ten years. However, this kind of domestic abuse is becoming a trend in the post-1980s generation who has a higher average level of education. In the past, it was regarded as domestic affairs. Nevertheless, as it is more and more common, some provinces consider making law to protect family members’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Marriage Law describes a lot about physical abuse, but only mentions that couples could not hurt the other in psychology. “Cold violence does not have obvious appearance, so it’s very hard to confirm it is really exist,” said Chen. She felt frustrated to recognize it’s so hard to help women to get rid of cold violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Chen’ client was a woman lived in Chenghai (Chen declined to give the woman’s name in order to protect her.) The husband didn’t talk to the woman for more than one year because she couldn’t give birth to a baby. The woman couldn’t bear her husband ignoring her for such a long time that she got mental disease. She had been ill for more than two years and finally divorced her husband. As there were no prove of cold violence using, the woman couldn’t get anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this poor woman, about one-third of China’s 267 million families have experienced some form of domestic violence, a recent survey by the All-China Women’s Federation found. About 88% of China’s couples didn’t talk to each other after quarreling for days or even months, according a recent survey by China’s Law Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some provinces had been considered to make law about the cold violence. From the year 2005, Beijing Women’s Federation had been trying to make a regulation about this and had set up 19 Women’s Legal Aid Center. Receiving more case about women asking for help about cold violence, Zhejiang had even made a regulation about domestic abuse and wanted to put cold violence in it on March, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen is encouraged that people are paying attention to cold violence, however she think it hard to make a law about this more private area. “Even if there is a law, it’s almost impossible to really put it into force,” said Chen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However she was optimistic about reducing cold violence. “Maybe the next generation or our grandson’s generation would be able to find a solution to prevent cold violence. What women should do now is survive on our own by becoming more independent in thinking and financially,” added Chen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steam Car Washing Brings Hope</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/steam-car-washing-brings-hope.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Bao Chengrong (Kate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Electric-15bar-mobile-Steam-car-wash_60347107372.html?spm=a2700.7724857.29.73.Gtzi8f&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/F936D65C-4806-4F9A-B5FA-7FE0E8284FCC.png&quot; alt=&quot;steam car washing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, Zheng Kehong, a creative businessman suddenly came up with a fresh idea: a way to dry-clean cars that would be environmentally friendly and would save energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You only need three bowls of water to wash a car,” said Kehong, the designer of steam car washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He felt excited and couldn’t wait to tell his partner Zheng Shaopeng about it. They soon involved in the research and built a company in Shantou named Jieneng Electric Apparatus and Technology. Shaopeng, a skillful electro-mechanic, created the machine Kehong imagined. After four years’ efforts, the new generation of a steam car-washing machine finally hit the market in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, about 150 new machines have been manufactured and sold to many northern cities in China, where water is more scarce, including Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang. Kehong even planned to sell them abroad this year. However, none have been used in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kehong said, “the realization of environmental protection by Shantou citizens needs time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machine costs about 11,200 kunas, four times the amount of regular car washing equipment. But its savings are long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new machine has the opportunity to help Shantou battle its water shortage. A 2008 article in Eastday news said Shantou is one of main areas in Guandong province lacking in water. Based on 2006 data, the average amount of water resources per capita in Shantou is 426 cubic metres (426,000 liters) per year, only 17 percent of the provincial rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car washing is one of the most water-consuming industries. According to a 2008 Shantou Daily article, Shantou residents owned about 614,000 vehicles, including 159,000 cars by 2008. A normal car wash consumes about 150 liters per car, according to Dahua news agency. Using the 2008 statistics, if 614,000 vehicles are washed one time a year, 92.1 million liters of water is used. If all of those cars used the steam machine, only 1 percent of the wastewater would be used or 921,000 liters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a car washing station in Tuopu, a worker, who used a high-pressure water jet for car washing, spent almost 20 minutes to finish the whole process till the land around him was soaking with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Zhongwei, the manager of this station said they needed about 500 liters water was needed to wash a car. If every car in Shantou was washed just one time a year in his station, 307 million liters of water would be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the normal car washing machine is unable to function in cold temperatures especially if it is snowing, because the chemicals in detergent would easily freeze. But the steam car washing machine has no such worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technology is on the market that recycles water for car washing circulating polluted water through the system. However, Kehong said the cost of the equipment is higher than the steam car washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the advantages of the steam car washing machine, many people are reluctant to invest the large sum of money into the equipment. A normal car washing machine used in Zhuanliang car washing station costs about 2,800 yuan, four times cheaper than Kehong’s machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang Qiao, the 33-year-old manager of this station, showed a great interest in the new machine and asked many questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But I am wondering about the electricity bill needed by this machine. If it takes more than 700 yuan per month, I will certainly not use it,” Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Yang, the average of water bill in his station is around 700 yuan per month. Yang also doubted whether steam could completely clean a car, especially if mud and dust on a car is thick. But Kehong responded the pressure is strong enough to clean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhongwei, the manager of Beverly Special Car Washing Station said he thought steam car washing could only be used inside but not outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t heard about it (use steam to wash the whole car) before”, he said, “But if the cost is reasonable, I will consider it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kehong said he has not widely advertised his product in Shantou. “I have tried to advertise it in Television newspaper, but only received two inquiry calls,” he said. He also mentioned that they regarded Internet as the main means for advertisement at present because of shortage in human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, high-pressure water jet for car washing has continued to play a key role in car washing industry in Shantou. The new machine still has a long way to go in exploring a potential market here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paper factory waste harms the community</title>

&lt;p&gt;By Zhao Yanxian (Yan)&lt;br /&gt;
The black water in Tuoji River flows silently, with plenty of water hyacinth and white bubbles floating on its surface. Two chimneys of Piaohe paper factory emit a black tail of gas into the sky. A 50 cm wide pipe pours wastewater into the river directly day and night, and the water of Tuoji River suddenly turns white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not far from this pipe, farmers, who own the land on one side of Tuoji River near the factory, irrigate the farm with the river’s black water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The water must be harmful to us. All of the villagers eat the vegetable which grow on the bank of the river and irrigated by this water,” said Cai Qingxing, a village doctor in Judeng, who keeps records of all the villagers who died of cancer since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started to keep records because, he said, he believes the river may be related to the sudden increase in the number of deaths from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 10 years before 1992, only 3 people died of cancer of the 2,000 villagers in Judeng, he said. But in 2002 and 2003 six people died of cancer each year. While no one died of cancer in 2004, seven people died in 2005 and again in 2006. Another five people died of cancer in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The river is smelly all year round,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuoji River, which is part of the Han River, was enlarged to 60 meters width in 1958. The water was so clean it was easy to see plenty of fish swimming in it and the villagers used the water for drinking and washing, Cai said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything changed suddenly in the late 1980s. Several factories were built in Chanan County, upstream of Tuoji River. The water turned black and released a bad odor. Fish seemed to vanish. The river began to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The situation was worse when the paper factory was set up in 1992,” said Cai Xiong, a 68-year-old villager of Judeng. The water hyacinth invaded the river and was so dense it could be used to cross the river, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The water could not flow because of too much water hyacinth,” he said. Thirty villagers were hired by the office of Judeng to clean the river using axes to cut water hyacinth at their roots that were tangled to one another. Villagers spent more than 10 days to clean the river but it is still invaded by hyacinth several times in a year. Some people were hired by neighboring Chaonan county office to clean the river whenever the hyacinth got too thick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuoiji River is now known as the “black river” to every villager. Whenever the upstream water flows past the paper factory it turns grey and is covered with floating white bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no sewage treatment in the factory absolutely,” said Zhong Chuiliang, one of the farmers in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The factory owner must have a good relationship with the government. I assume that because in February, an investigator from Beijing came to make a survey of the pollution of the river but I saw the discharge of the sewage never stop,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Yuanyou, an officer of another neighboring county, Tuolian, is preparing a project in water pollution for the entire Tuopu district of which Judeng is a part. He confirmed that an investigator had come and done a survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is the first time an inspector from Beijing to check the pollution and they came without any notice,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Water Pollution, Prevention and Control charter of China adopted on June 1, 2008, says there should be “comprehensive management.” However, environmental protection is not everyone’s priority and is sometimes seen as a matter of beauty instead of health of people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li said the government knows the pollution is serious, but the authority has to develop its economy first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without money, environmental beauty is useless,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Environmental Protection Agency of Shantou, a branch of the national governmental organization, in 2009, the Tuoji River’s water is rated as second grade water of good quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Environmental Protection Agency of Shantou does take some samples from rivers in Shantou and do tests, but the results are never published,” said Li, the officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A researcher quoted in a 2007 article from A View on China Technology, said wastewater from paper factories is the biggest pollutant of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wastewater is in a high temperature, filled with alkaline material and tiny fibres. These fibres float above the water and inhibit the sun light from reaching the flora and fauna at the bottom of the river, which kills them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecosystem is permanently damaged by this kind of water that also has other poisons and heavy metals. The benthos flora and fauna die and the fish populations vanish. With factories’ wastewater, the river cannot recover. According to the magazine article, the second ecosystem killer is the water hyacinth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some fish that were transported by a flood from a pond into the river died soon after, said another farmer, Guo Chuiliang, 68.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We cannot see any more fish in the river now,” Guo said. “My vegetables turn from green to white after a few times irrigating them with Tuoji River water. I harvested them and tried to sell them in the market but nobody preferred to buy them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers will sell their product in Tuopu market. Some of the farmers are oblivious to the effect the water pollution has on their fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our vegetables are better than others in the market which are produced in other province. Water from river does help to the growth of vegetables because it contains fertilizer,” Cai said. “All of our villagers eat vegetables from this land.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Cai said a villager once brought vegetables from a farmer in Judeng. She soaked them in some water until noon when she wanted to cook them for lunch. But she found some foam floating at the water’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It should be something harmful in the vegetable, but nobody has tested it. Other people from other villages who are familiar with the situation, refuse to buy our products,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers use barrels of water to irrigate their fields because they have no irrigation equipment. The ditches where they pour the water were as dark and smelly as the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tried to report this problem to an officer of the People’s Political Consultative Conference last year,” the doctor said. “But the officer said to me, the pollution all over China is serious. I cannot do anything about the pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Different Water Price on Each Side of the Street</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/different-water-price-on-each-side-of-the-street.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By He Shan Shan (Sammy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Tuopu general market, people living a few meters apart on the same side of the street can be charged different prices for their water depending on who manages their liquid resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The water price is so high that I can’t accept it, and my business is also poor,” Zhuang Wenhao complained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Zhuang’s shop, the water price controlled by the water contractor is 3.65 yuan per ton. Lin Xuzhuang runs a shop just 30 meters away from Zhuang’s on the same side of street. His water, however, is managed by the water station, a subordinate governmental agency, and costs 3.2 yuan per ton. Zhuang hopes that the government can recover the contractor’s right in managing water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the NanFang Daily, before 1999, the water in many places in Shantou was provided by the Shantou City Water Company, a state-owned enterprise, which installed the total water table, and then handed over the controls to the community residents’ committees or the private contractors. Both of them raised the price in order to recover their costs for raising the water pressure to reach each user’s house and maintaining the ageing pipes that leak out large amounts of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The distance between my shop and house is only a street, but I have to go to two places to pay the water bills. It is too inconvenient,” said Tang Fusheng who has been running a small grocery store for ten years in the Tuopu general market. The water in the shop is governed by the governmental agency while the water in his house, on the other side of the street, is managed by the contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tang’s opinion, the quarrel with the contractor is so cumbersome that most people complain in private but do nothing beyond that to change their situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to change the water management mess, in 1999, the water company started to a reform project so that the water is only provided by the ShanTou City Water Company, a state-owned company. Ten years later, the some of the residents’ water still isn’t controlled by the water company. But the reform project moved slowly due to the high cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shantou government has aimed to have all water controlled by the Shantou City water company by 2013 and to have a unified water price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen Fenzhuang, a worker in Tuopu water station, said, “In two or three years, the contractor and the water station in Tuopu will be lost, the Shantou City water company will come to manage the water directly.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tuopu Carries on Christian Tradition with Four Churches</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/tuopu-carries-on-christian-tradition-with-four-churches.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By: Natalie, Amber, Yan, Jimmy, Riko&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/02/DSC_0105-e1386531091984-520x245.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_0105-e1386531091984-520x245&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the harmonious rhythm of religious hymns, they walked slowly around the hall.Among them, some were the old and some were young, some were men and some were women. Some of them were wearing white dresses. As they were doing scripture reading, echos could be clearly heard in the ten-feet high hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene was taking place in a church in Pengzhou, a village located three kilometers away from Shantou University in the community of Tuopu. But – surprising for a community of its size – Tuopu has not one but four Chrisitian churches, leftovers from the time of Opium War treaties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent Sunday, Rongyao church attracted more than 300 people for a religious service. For at least one believer there, the Christianity was all about personal faith that required few trappings and ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Christianity gives you freedom, while Buddhism only causes you troubles,” said Li Dongli, a 17-year-old girl who is also a member of the choir. Li’s family has believed in Christianity since her grandparents’ generation. Having got used to the custom of the religion since she was young, Li regarded Christianity as “a simple way to tie you to a belief”. She thought what a Buddhist does was complex because of all the ceremonies in Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://515061.cn/bbs/thread-1881-1-1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/02/74_1250240897BmbB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo from 515061.cn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christianity has had a history in the Chaoshan area since the late-nineteenth century, when China was invaded by foreigners and forced to open several port cities. Treaties after the Opium Wars opened several coastal cities, among them Chaozhou. Due to strong anti-foreign sentiment, foreign diplomats chose to establish themselves in Shantou port, about sixty kilometers from the prefectural city. Since then, people in this region began to know, accept and embrace Christianity, with foreigners, including missionaries flocking to this Christianity-free new land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuopu, and especially Pengzhou village within Tuopu, was a natural spot for churches, as it was one of the original built-up, developed spaces in the Shantou. Also, Tuopu is adjacent to Niutianyang, one of the bays in Shantou and one of the first places that foreigners arrived in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics shows that more than 300 religious sites are located in Shantou, fifteen of them Christian churches distributed in three of the main districts Jinping, Longhu and Dahao in this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With priests in charge, religious affairs are held regularly in these churches. Priests rotate through the churches of Shantou, coming regularly to churches for Sunday services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Shuren, one of these priests from Chaoyang, came to Rongyao Tang this week. “More churches were built since 1980s, for the sake of the spiritual requirements of local people,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that before 1980s, religious places were badly damaged in the Cultural Revolution. Some of them were seized by government and put in use as cattle-sheds. “All the churches were mindlessly destroyed by the Red Guards,” Li said in a tremulous voice. The Red Guards arrested people who went to church, which forced the others to stay at home and pray secretly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cultural Revolution, religious activities were allowed in China again. A number of churches in Shantou were rebuilt at that time. Even more were newly founded. As people’s concepts were focusing more on western society, religious perspective grew in this port city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monument was hung up in Rongyao Tang, memorializing the foundation of the church. It said that the church was built in 2001, based on the damaged yet original one which had been in use for more than 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to competing with other religious beliefs, Li Xuehong, director of Rongyao Tang, described what seemed to be a policy of discrimination against Christian churches. Based on the policy launched by the central government, no procedure is needed when establishing Buddhist temples. However, people had to get permission once they wanted to build a church. “It’s unfair. Buddhist and Christian are the same because they both have a belief,” recalled Li.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li also described persecution believers in Christianity had suffered during the Cultural Revolution, Li Xuehong took out an old notebook which contained church history. One sentence wrote that numerous Christian families, perforce, destroyed their family Bibles for safety reasons. Li said a missionary who had suffered from persecution died in the prison in his forties. He was charged with superstition. But Li refused to reveal his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other churches in Tuopu is named Xidong Tang from the same name of the village Xidong. The church’s director, Xiao Shiyong, was in business in his early years. After traveling in foreign commercial circles, he embraced Christianity and got back to his hometown Xidong village. In 1930s, he established the Xidong Tang. Xiao said there were only three families believed in Christianity at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, the church was rebuilt several times for different reasons. At the same time more and more villagers chose Christianity as their belief. Comparing with the past, Xiao said over 200 villagers from 1,000 in total in Xidong are now Christians. The four generations of his family are Christians since Xiao’s age. Xiao added his family had led a good life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We walk with God. I’ve never doubted my belief,” Xiao said with a big smile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Over fishing and Water Pollution Threaten Local Fishermen</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/over-fishing-and-water-pollution-threaten-local-fishermen.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Su Dongxia (Evana)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://e.news.163.com/docs/99/2015111320/B8B11QF6051484PE.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/hP3D87YM42iNjmGP9RSk67Nx2C7qmwOoAkCAcOWMM410QW1447417263852compressflag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;overfishing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several ducks swim on the river surface. Sometimes they fight each other over small fish. Sometimes they play for fun and are oblivious to danger. A man advances toward them quietly, suddenly he moves fast, aims at one of the ducks with a pot, raises his arm: a duck gets caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xie Mingju, 42, was a fisherman for almost 30 years owning a boat on XinJin River that he would take out to sea. Now he seldom goes out and raises ducks and pigs instead. Although Xie and his wife Pang Jie have turned to pig and duck farming, they cannot escape the slow pollution of the waters around them whether in the sea or the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once in October every year, Kingfish appears in River Xin Jin. Now this kind of fish is dying out and we rarely see them,” Xie said. Kingfish used to fetch a price of 80 Yuan per kilo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 60 boats in Yong’an Village and Xie knows almost all of them. They used to go fishing together, but now many of them have changed their jobs. Some are drivers, others have started businesses. Last year, he raised about 100 pigs and this year he has raised almost 300 ducks so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We get little fish now, 80 percent of the reason is because of the environment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight 200-horsepower fishing boats from neighboring Island Nan’ao or Fujian Province, use bombs for fishing, he said. When they use this method of fishing, nearly all the fish are killed. Another fisherman, Lu Xiaobing, confirms the appearance of these bombing boats on the sea in May or June. But Lu and Xie’s boats are just 15-horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, 100 boats from Chenghai also fish in the same waters and use electrical current to fish, Xie said. These fishing methods kill all the fish including the small ones therefore depleting much of the fish population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the fishing administrative authority just ignores them even they see what is happening,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mai Xianshi, the captain of Shantou’s Fishing Administrative Authority said they work to stop illegal fishing boats using electricity or bombs. When they get a tip from anyone including anonymous sources, they take action, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou’s Fishing Administrative Authority caught four boats using electrical current to fish on Mar. 17, 2009, said Zheng Kexiong, the director-general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mai, fishermen who do not use electrical current to fish can receive national assistance. However, Xie said most of the fishermen in his village never receive any subvention. In fact, their boats are also illegal because they are not registered in Hukou. The processes for registering their boats are complex and cost them more money than they can afford, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It can’t be denied that the fishermen are having a hard time, because the fishermen really get less fish. And when we catch the illegal boats, we try to teach them the laws and fine less money,” said the director of the fishing authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zheng, once a fisherman, knows the fishing resources are depleting and that fishermen are having a hard time. That is why, when they catch the small illegal boats, they just fine them without confiscating their boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, Xie could expect to fish the equivalent of about 1,200 Yuan a day. But that is now rare. A fisherman today gets about 100 Yuan a day, he said. But the costs to make and maintain a boat and the equipment are too high. He made the hull of his boat. He then bought and equipped the engine for about 7,000 Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to spend more than 10,000 Yuan if you want to make a new fishing boat now.” The fishermen need to spend an additional 15,000 Yuan to buy or change the nets. Besides, every time they go fishing they have to pay 40 Yuan to buy diesel oil.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xie Laosan, another fisherman, said, “my best money now is more than 100 Yuan. Sometimes I couldn’t get anything at all.” The most popular fish to catch is the Doufu fish known for its lack of scales and wide mouth ranging from 0.15 kilos to 0.25 kilos in weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yong’an Village has a big industrial estate with many companies. Xie said, “There were two sewage pools behind the Yai Hing Industrial City. And the sewage was black and smelly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yai Hing company is a factory specialized in the electroplating process to make jewelry. Two security guards forbade access to the factory and said they risked their jobs if they did not intimidate newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Shantou Environmental Protection Agency, Yai Ching was one of the 64 enterprises that had reached pollution emission standards in 2006. A worker at the monitoring department of the EPA, who refused to give his name, said the company probably met the standards. But, he added, his department was not well equipped and he was not sure about the quality of Xinjin River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen Xichuan’s job is to deal with polluted water of Shantou Sez Wingluen Wear Dyeing Factory. He said, “The polluted water has arrived the pollution emission standards. Since 1999, I have been doing this. Our company’s product aims at exporting to western countries and our customers care about the environment very much. On Mar. 27, a HK customer arrived at the factory to check whether our company deserves to place orders or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen also said the Shantou Environmental Protection Agency comes to check the company at different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Yong’an Village Neighborhood Committee, four men played cards on two separate occasions. They would not facilitate a meeting with their director to ask about Xinjin River and were unwilling to answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction companies working on sites near the river often pour cement directly into the river according to witnesses including one employee of a cement factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former fisherman’s wife does not see the problem with residential areas dumping their sewage directly into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pang slaughters the ducks she and her husband raise after customers come to select the one they want to buy. She then pours the dirty water into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says the river is clean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Sewage System High Risk for Lower Parts of Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/old-sewage-system-high-risk-for-lower-parts-of-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Zhong Jing Zhen (Tiffany)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nianzhi.cc/weibo/3835186645181797&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/8ed2396dgw1ergq7hij2xj20c8096jse-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sewage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would put on the plastic boots, roll up his trousers and finally cover his nose with his hands when stepping out of his small home to go for a walk early in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qiu Tongzhi, 68, has been living in No.4 of Lane 3, Xia Ling Street, Wu Qiao Island for six decades. For more than two years no government employees have come to clear the sewage drains, he said. Instead the local residents hired plumbers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is too smelly,” he complained, “The upwelling water underneath the blocked sewers get about a foot deep on the ground, every 3rd and 18th day (of the lunar calendar) from August to October when the tide comes in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tongzhi also said that the situation was made worse every time heavy rains arrive. Most low-lying regions in Shantou including Wu Qiao Island, Little Park and Apricot Blossom Street are inundated with water spilling out of the overburden sewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our store was flooded six inches deep as rain drops mixed with water under the drains after torrential rains,” Hong said, the wife of the owner of Zheng Tai Store which sells dried seafood in Little Park. “Not until the rain stopped could we restart our enterprise after we swept and mopped the dirty floor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some schools like Yu Huai Middle School suffer from a similar predicament. Students have had to remove their shoes and roll up their trousers while walking towards the classroom building through the schoolyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic problems, in particular, worsen in such situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accumulated water provides more resistance to any forms of transportation and brings additional difficulties in traffic. Both vehicle and people can be seen being caught in the rain and wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A motorcycle taxi driver, Zhang Anran, who lives in Apricot Blossom Street one of the most frequently flooded district complained in his Hubei accent, “The depth of accumulated water that reached my legs stopped me from carrying passengers and fewer people came out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Hou Guang, who was once working in police station of Apricot Blossom Street and is now part of a group called the Zone Defense Members w, said safety threats matter a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year different buildings in Xin Xiang Village near Apricot Blossom Bridge collapse following the heavy rainstorm because the accumulated floods resulting from the overburden sewers weakened the foundations and walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are organized to rescue more than twenty of the old, the little children and the bedridden patients from the danger,” said Hou Guang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Shantou is located at the mouth of three rivers Hanjiang River, Rongjiang River and Lianjiang River，most drains lower than the sea level are blocked easily with the tidal backwater, according to Cai Huiyuan, 31, the Townscape Deputy Section Chief of City Management Bureau in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan said aged and damaged drainpipes too small in diameter contribute much to sewage blockage. Furthermore, sludge and discharge of rubbish like boxes and plastic bags also clog the drains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of road construction reform including sewers reconstruction in Huang Shan Road, Zhu Jiang Road and San Jiao Guan Valley has finished, which reduces the certain tension on drains. The reconstruction included installing water mains designed to cut off polluted waste from sewage, and six high-pressure pump stations used to drain water forcibly with one of which in Apricot Blossom Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey of public intentions in Wu Qiao Island of removal and rebuilding the region the most low-lying area into a big market is under way since 2008, with the purpose of economic development and a solution to drains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Actually, the lack of money of the government is the root of drains problem,” said Zheng Junran, 31, the Assistant Engineer of Municipal Engineering Service Centre in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only less than thirty female workers of Municipal Engineering Service Centre from the first drain cleaning line, dealing with the blocked sewers all over the city from Monday to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“About thirty civilians next week will be hired to help the government cleaners,” said Tan Dingjie, 40, the Subsection Chief of Manufacturing Technique of Municipal Engineering Service Centre. “We need more, both cleaners and new sewers, but funds shortage still gets in the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is still a long way to go,” he added, “More money will be better to support our government to solve drains problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Agriculture Weakened by Factory Pollutants</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/agriculture-weakened-by-factory-pollutants.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Wang Xiuli (Lily)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dahuawang.com/stwb/html/2015-03/26/content_611776.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/res01_attpic_brief.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;factory pollution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little boy was playing delightedly near the water lock. “Go away, it’s so dangerous,” shouted an old man. As the wind blew, the deep water in Niu Tianyang flowed rapidly creating a loud sound. The water lock links to the sea and anyone in its waters risks being carried out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are many factories around Niu Tianyang, such as the medicine factory, alcohol factory, food factory and so on. The clean water has been polluted by their waste water,” said Liu Liangqing, a security guard of Niu Tianyang military area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Liu, people here feed saltwater fish, shrimp and crab. Most of the aquaculture in Niu Tianyang is done by people who lease the land from the military in charge of the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The water of Niu Tianyang comes from the ocean, there are nearly seven big water locks, they will bring in the water during high tide and lead the water out during low tide,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the water is pumped in and out with the tide, nobody can ensure a great deal of clean water, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Huanchao, an employee of a pharmaceutical company, called Sea Area Aquaculture Company, said the wastewater from the factory goes directly into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dirty water affects the harvest of the aquatic products and the culturist’s income. The fish and crab either die prematurely or do not grow well. Some of the farmers tried to put disinfectants into the pond, but it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Guanwang has been engaged in feeding fresh fish for two years using the water from river of Tuo Ji He. A few years ago, while the river had clean water, he had a big harvest, but now the polluted water has a bad smell and a different color than the normal water and his harvest gets infected, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can see that there are a few factories around here,” Lin said pointing to a big building far away. “Others who run the sea water culture are much luckier than me, because they use the sea water, it’s better than the Tuo Ji He.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he bought the disinfectant, which is used to clean the water of the pond, it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The government knows about the conditions, but they didn’t take any actions to help us, they didn’t care at all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the fishermen, the fruit growers also complain about the water quality of the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As usual, we lead the water of Tuo JI He to irrigate the garden tree. Though the fruit guava has a fresh green color, it doesn’t taste very fragrant and sweet, nearly tasteless, but I don’t know what to do,” said Liu DaMo, a garden owner in Niu Tianyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zhuang Xiao who is the officer of information department in the Environmental Protection Agency of Shan Tou, said they had taken charge in the water pollution of river and canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007 they received a notice on the pollution of Tuo Ji river. They appointed workers to investigate and found the pollution was from wastewater poured by factories and sewage from residential areas. According to him, “we have taken actions to deal with the rivers and canals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new law on water pollution prevention and control was put in practice in June 1st last year. Factories that pour wastewater would be fined, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niu Tianyang is located in the western part of Shan Tou along the South China Sea, Rong Jiang and Lian Jiang River. Decades ago people turned the beach into farmland in Niu Tianyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after a heavy tsunami in 1969 and small harvests, people decided to turn the field into ponds for aquaculture, an area of 26,000 mu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Migrant Workers in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/migrant-workers-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rural population in China is about one billion. They contribute a lot to China’s development, but enjoy fewer privileges compared to people who live in cities. Their life, income, medical care and education are still worse. In order to have a better life, most of them choose to work in cities. They mostly do hard jobs which the city people feel ashamed to do, and they save as much money as they can to bring back home. Near JinPing Industrial Area in Shantou, there are a group of migrant workers from Hunan Province living in poor, dirty wooden houses. The place has no specific name, even the fire engines and the ambulances spent a long time to find there when a fire broke out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fall of the Baby Eel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Xu Jiang Yun (Sunny)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://image.baidu.com/search/detail?ct=503316480&amp;amp;z=0&amp;amp;ipn=d&amp;amp;word=%E6%B1%95%E5%A4%B4%E5%B9%BC%E9%B3%97%E9%B1%BC%E9%87%8F%E4%B8%8B%E9%99%8D&amp;amp;step_word=&amp;amp;pn=1&amp;amp;spn=0&amp;amp;di=152532366032&amp;amp;pi=&amp;amp;rn=1&amp;amp;tn=baiduimagedetail&amp;amp;is=&amp;amp;istype=2&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;in=&amp;amp;cl=2&amp;amp;lm=-1&amp;amp;st=-1&amp;amp;cs=1714047255%2C1724137221&amp;amp;os=2812156325%2C535521306&amp;amp;simid=3493367985%2C213544613&amp;amp;adpicid=0&amp;amp;ln=36&amp;amp;fr=&amp;amp;fmq=1456832722761_R&amp;amp;ic=0&amp;amp;s=undefined&amp;amp;se=&amp;amp;sme=&amp;amp;tab=0&amp;amp;width=&amp;amp;height=&amp;amp;face=undefined&amp;amp;ist=&amp;amp;jit=&amp;amp;cg=&amp;amp;bdtype=0&amp;amp;objurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.step.com.cn%2Fres%2F1%2F50%2F2009-08%2F02%2F02%2Fres01_attpic_brief.jpg&amp;amp;fromurl=ippr_z2C%24qAzdH3FAzdH3Fooo_z%26e3Bfpjr_z%26e3Bv54_z%26e3BvgAzdH3Fip4sAzdH3Fdaal-abAzdH3FadAzdH3Fv5gpjgp_898nm_z%26e3Bip4&amp;amp;gsm=0&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/u17140472551724137221fm21gp0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;baby eel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xu Leiyong was smoking quietly, sitting in the bow of his boat. At his side, his wife Shen Xiaofeng was cleaning up the fishing nets. It isn’t the end of the season for baby eels but they have no intention of fishing the baby eels again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s more and more difficult to catch baby eels now, even at a time when cold,” said Xu, who has almost eight years for the baby eel fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season of baby eel began in early February this year. In general, the quantity of the baby eels will increase when it gets colder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The number of the baby eels has reduced substantially since 2007,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to China Eel, a government website that gathers data on eels, the amount of baby eels caught has been steadily decreasing from 69.8 tons in 2006, 43 tons in 2007, to 21.7 tons in 2008 in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national problem is reflected in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishermen in Shantou including Xu catch baby eels at Hanjiang River estuary every year. The local media reported many times that in recent years, the pollution in Hanjiang River has been more and more serious, while the marine environment near the Shantou Port was also damaged because of the ongoing port construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Water quality deterioration is the main reason for the reduction of baby eels,” said Li Yuanyou, the director of the institute of marine biology in Shantou University, and one of the directors of Guangdong Zoological Society and Guangdong Ocean (limnology) Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Eels require good quality of the living environment. Once the water has been contaminated, the resistance of the eels is visibly reduced and then they will be sick or even die. Also, the polluted environment will affect their reproductive capacity directly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eels live in the river and migrate to the ocean to spawn babies when they are mature. They spawn only once in their lifetime and die right after the spawning. After a period of time, the babies will return to the river on their own to grow into adults and begin the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the pollution problem isn’t solved effectively, the survival rate of the eel will continue to decline,” Li said. “The less mothers migrate to the sea to spawn, and the less babies can return to the river. It is a vicious circle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition, over-fishing is also a reason for the reduction of baby eels,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishermen are further affected by the lowering price of baby eels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a baby eel fetches only 1 yuan to 2 yuan compared to 15 yuan or more last year, Xu’s wife said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of fishermen are upset and angry about the fall in price. They have to suspend the baby eel fishing in order to reduce their losses. The fuel for the boat, the fishing equipment and manpower are all a spending for the fishing. The fishermen usually work in the evening because baby eels mostly appear at night. They need to set the nets away from the water gate and catch baby eels with the tides. Lighting is also important because it will attract more baby eels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The price is too low. Continuing to catch baby eels is only a thankless task,” Xu said. He has decided to catch other seafood and wait for the upcoming spring fishing season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The purchasing amount of the eel fishery determines the price of baby eels. The price will decline when the purchasing amount becomes smaller,” said Chen Songshou, the business manager of Shantou Manlian CO, LTD, which is one of the eel farming and processing companies in Shantou. Its fisheries buy baby eels from the local fishermen every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou adult eels are mainly exported abroad, especially to the number one consumer: Japan. On Jan. 30, 2008, 10 Japanese got food poisoning after they ate some dumplings made in China. Subsequently, Japan stepped up its monitoring of Chinese food and stopped the sale of Chinese food in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It led to a substantial reduction of the eel exports,” Chen said. The statistics from the Customs of China shows that the number of roast eels imported by Japan from China dropped by 75.5 percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The export of roast eels and live eels is reducing, and the domestic market is also depressed. Consequently, the scale of the eel fishery become smaller and smaller and is no longer to purchase large numbers of baby eels,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Once a Smelly Canal, Always a Smelly Canal</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/once-a-smelly-canal-always-a-smelly-canal.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tieba.baidu.com/p/2372384170&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/bf096b63f6246b6023239fc9eaf81a4c510fa259.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;smelly canal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;photo from tieba.baidu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trees line both sides of the canal. The water is green with yellow leaves and some garbage such as some white disposable lunch boxes on the canal. That is the Longhu Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longhu Canal, the 7.3 kilometers long canal across Longhu and Jinpin district in Shantou, used to be the main source of water for fields near the canal.&lt;br /&gt;
However, as urbanization caused more people to move to Shantou, industrial and domestic sewage also grew and poured into the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from a Shantou Huangxing primary school student’s essay which posted on www.zwz.cn, entitled “The complaint of Longhu Canal,” says it all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am a dirty and smelly river. But that is not my original appearance. I used to be clean and there were many fishes. However, after a chemical factory set up nearby, my life was changed. The polluted water made by factory and people were poured into the river. The water was smelly, fishes were dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Muwei was born and raised on a street near the canal where he now works as a guard along its banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People could swim in the canal or even use the water to cook”, continued the 74-year-old man, “but after reforming and opening, polluted water from factories and residential district were pour into the canal, including the flushing water, making the canal smelly and full of Hyacinth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was referring to the time since the early 1980s when Shantou was designated as one of China’s special economic zones to stimulate development and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang recalled, “At that time, the color of the water was black, just like the color of ink. I could smell the stench in my house, which was about 30 meters away. Everyone who passed the Longhu Canal would cover their nose. When the weather was hot, the stench would be more terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Shantou government, in the National People’s Congress and the Chinese Political Consultative Conference, cleaning Longhu Canal became a priority. In 2003, the government determined to clean Longhu Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shantou Chengguan (a city management office) stated that the cleaning project would clear the silt and pollutants in the canal completely. Then they would install a pipe to the sewage treatment plants to transport the dirty water. Finally, they would divert the water from Han River, which is the longest river (410 kilometers) in Chaoshan district and the second longest river in Guangdong province, to Longhu Canal in order to clean the canal and make the water flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cleaning project was set up in Dec.31, 2003, and substantially completed in 2008, lasted for four years, and cost 148 million RMB, according to Shantou government website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environment of Longhu Canal in Longhu district has improved. Trees are growing, stone benches are built on both sides of the canal. Some simple fitness equipment such as parallel bars are also built near the canal. Many people sit on the benches or play with the equipments. In Jinping district, on one side of the Longhu Canal is a big lawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhang Weiting lives nearby and she plays with her daughter in the lawn. She said, “the environment is OK here. Even though the river also smelly, if you do not get close to the river you won’t smell the unpleasant smell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anyway, the lawn is good. There are many people like to play here at noon, especially the children and old man. Children like to play games here and old man come here to take a walk or play chess together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the Canal in Jinping district is an about 1 meter wide greenbelt, which separates the river from the living area. Some stone chairs and tables are located in the greenbelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhu Qiyuan, a grade four school child sat by a stone table doing his homework. He does not live in this area but likes to come here to the cleanest part of the canal in this district although, he admits, it is still smelly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garbage alongside the canal in both Jinping district and Longhu district point to the canal’s future. Empty plastic bags and disposable lunchboxes litter the sides of the canal. No garbageÂ  containers or cleaners are in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Muwei said there are cleaners who are specially in charge of the canal’s cleaning. “They are not doing their job regularly. I don’t exactly know when they will show up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang and his friends who are retired workers living near Longhu Canal are all satisfied with the cleaning project, “after the cleaning project, even though the quality of water cannot back to the original state, it’s better than when the water were smelly and fishes are back to this canal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they also said they worried about the Longhu Canal’s future. The pipes connected to the sewage treatment plants are made of rubber. Even though the Shantou Department of Water Resources claimed that the pipes are strong enough and save money, Wang and his friends still think pipes made of reinforced concrete would be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I always think the situation won’t last long because I am afraid the pipe will break sooner or later. And people’s environment awareness also need to be enhanced. Anyway, I hope the situation today will continue.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deciphering water purification in swimming pools</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/deciphering-water-purification-in-swimming-pools.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Chen Yubo (Judy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/guilherme-pavan/7970711908/in/photolist-d9kYXo-28h9Lt-jFVBqj-a3DU65-3q1on-a3HcuZ-JF8u1-2QN6vx-8Kou92-D7M1B-6QiPqi-VCpxx-ddBpRa-6uuBUY-DdrWg-2anePu-2an7Xw-28ojZK-59ZZsT-72C2VL-Ub64W-2q9YMh-4wCQUv-8RvaPA-2h9CTu-nZDtFo-8Rvcbh-evsd3-ej3gsq-P1d6c-XPeGX-gyLJ3T-o7FMGS-6gxgwJ-6NLehN-2c4brV-2c4gJe-2anbBM-6xXUWi-3vMnA1-4azaG9-2QN6Nn-MYhfj-3vGnDB-2JzqL-2c8JuW-4wCMZK-9UJULk-4R2qbt-omwMHY&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/DEF06511-185E-4E15-9F44-F3F1A08C12AA.png&quot; alt=&quot;swimming pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun shines brightly and light twinkles on the surface of the swimming pool. Everything looks peaceful and quiet. Suddenly, the calm is broken by the sound of people flapping and splashing water. Despite the March cold, even the weather does not prevent people from swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People in Shantou like swimming very much,” said Yang Qingwei, who is in charge of the operation of Zhongshan Park, where there is also a swimming pool. “More than 1,000 people came to our swimming pool in a day in summer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there are so many people, the quality of the water has become a topic of public concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We adopt the cycle of water purification devices, which works about 15 hours every day in summer, and six hours every two days in winter,” said Zeng Yonghua, 35, the manager of the swimming pool in Zhongshan Park. “We usually change the entire water once a year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 80 swimming pools in total in Shantou among the hotels, schools and residential areas, according to Zhang Biaoming, the Chief of Policies and Regulations of Sports Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swimming pool in Zhongshan Park is one of the most famous swimming pools in Shantou. “Most of our customers are families, they train their children to learn swimming here,” Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two inlets and five outlets in the swimming pool in Zhongshan Park, and the latter is much bigger than the former. All the water entering into the pool has already been disinfected with Sodium Hypochlorite, which can protect people from the E. coli, a kind of bacterium which is harmful to the body when its content is more than 0.3mg per liter to 0.5 mg per liter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeng emphasized that Sodium Hypochlorite should be liquid rather than powder, as liquid can more easily evaporate. Every time they have to get a certificate of quality from the Health Inspection and Supervision Centre, in order to buy the chemicals from the factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swimming pool managers have an official record book from the quarantine station to keep track of the amounts of chemical agents poured into the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When the officials from the Health Inspection and Supervision Centre came, we showed the tally book to them,” Zeng said. “The inspectors often take a liter of water from the pool and add a special pill into it. And then the water becomesÂ  colored. They compare the color to the standard color on a kind of special test paper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We only are in charge of public swimming pools and go there irregularly. But we haven’t found any that have problems with the water,” said Zhang, the person in charge of inspecting pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cycle of water purification devices functions well, but is also expensive. “It will take about 600 RMB if it works for ten hours continuously, and each time it will lose 10% of water during the process of backwashing and sewage disposal,” Zeng added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced sterilization technology, however, is the ozone-activated carbon sterilization technology which combines the adsorption of activated carbon with the oxidization of Ozone. It is considered the most environment-friendly because it produces no secondary pollutants. This is the technology that was used in the National Aquatics Center during the Beijing Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because of its high equipment cost and large power consumption, it has only been used in the international competition swimming pool or a number of high-grade water parks. Even as the only national diving training base in Shantou, the swimming pool on the Haibin Road around the People’s Square still uses Sodium Hypochlorite for disinfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But the water here is blue while it’s green in most of ordinary swimming pools, as we used Copper Sulfate to limit the growth of phytoplankton,” said Ma Liguang, the leader of Shantou Diving Team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, another kind of advanced equipment plays an important role in the water purification in the diving pool. It’s called preparatory pool which has a corresponding water level with the diving pool. When the latter doesn’t have enough water, the former will flow into it automatically. “In this way, we don’t have to empty the pool to infuse new water,” Ma said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clean Water Shortage in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/clean-water-shortage-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Ye Xiao (Nika)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://image.baidu.com/search/detail?ct=503316480&amp;amp;z=0&amp;amp;ipn=d&amp;amp;word=%E6%B1%95%E5%A4%B4%E6%B0%B4%E6%B1%A1%E6%9F%93&amp;amp;step_word=&amp;amp;pn=27&amp;amp;spn=0&amp;amp;di=179128026880&amp;amp;pi=&amp;amp;rn=1&amp;amp;tn=baiduimagedetail&amp;amp;is=&amp;amp;istype=0&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;in=&amp;amp;cl=2&amp;amp;lm=-1&amp;amp;st=undefined&amp;amp;cs=1442055308%2C3703411043&amp;amp;os=4065881226%2C177708262&amp;amp;simid=3469050956%2C454585772&amp;amp;adpicid=0&amp;amp;ln=939&amp;amp;fr=&amp;amp;fmq=1456842491329_R&amp;amp;ic=undefined&amp;amp;s=undefined&amp;amp;se=&amp;amp;sme=&amp;amp;tab=0&amp;amp;width=&amp;amp;height=&amp;amp;face=undefined&amp;amp;ist=&amp;amp;jit=&amp;amp;cg=&amp;amp;bdtype=0&amp;amp;objurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi3.cqnews.net%2Fnews%2Fattachement%2Fjpg%2Fsite82%2F2011-02-23%2F3606193373136440944.jpg&amp;amp;fromurl=ippr_z2C%24qAzdH3FAzdH3Fgjof_z%26e3Bvqgjof_z%26e3BgjpAzdH3Fip4sAzdH3Fda88-adAzdH3FdnAzdH3Fv5gpjgp_c009888_z%26e3Bip4&amp;amp;gsm=0&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/3606193373136440944.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water pollution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;photo from baidu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark blue, gray, purple, Shantou City is divided into different colors on the map, the most prevalent being dark blue and purple, colors representing the most severe pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a common map. It’s the water pollution map based on 2004 China Environmental Statistics Communiques, and every color other than blue stands for pollution in different degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People have polluted the water sources,” said Yao Xiaoping, 43, a local citizen in Shantou, who criticized some of Shantou people’s behavior. “They throw the garbage in the water and pour dirty water into the river.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Long Hu River near Wal-Mart, in which her husband used to pick seashells, now gives off a noxious odor, resulting from a mixture of industrial waste-water and household garbage. Rivers are becoming increasingly smaller when garbage piles up on its bank and eventually invades the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xinghua Bridge, the trash heap, which has already occupied half of the river on the left side, is directly burning on the water. On the other side, the inundating hyacinth is seizing its territory. It blocks sunlight and starves oxygen in the water, competing with other aquatic plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never thought of water problem. I think everyone in Shantou has access to clean tap water,” said Lin Jingna, 38, a saleswoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Most people in Shantou do not have the sense of water problems. Actually in 2001, Shantou was listed among the cities of Guangdong with the most severe water shortage,” said Chen Changzhong, the director of the Bureau of Water Resources in Shantou. The measure of water supply, however, does not take into account the water sources such as the Han River that originates outside the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Frankly speaking, the water problem in Shantou does not lie in the quantity of water resources. The serious part is the water pollution,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just go to Chao Nan and Chao Yang districts and you will see the seriousness with your own eyes. In the past, Lian River across Shantou was widely used for washing or irrigation, but now, it is assessed as the ‘Worst Grade V,’ which means that the water has lost its function as ‘water.’ It can even be called as ‘poisonous water’. Now we are largely dependent on Han River,” Chen said frowning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the government is really determined to solve this problem, it’s not a problem anymore. Water shortage in Shantou is tied to pollution. With plenty water surrounding, Shantou is in desperate need of clean usable water,” said Lin’s husband who declined to give his name because of his work related to the local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 2007 Shantou and environs, with its population of 5 million, had only one sewage plant—Long Zhu Water Pollution Control Plant, according to the non-governmental Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. Furthermore, based on a database of the Institute, the sewage plant is inefficient in dealing with industrial waste water. Because the waste-water pipes do not match the nets for purifying the water, much of the waster water directly flows into the sea without being purified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since 2008, another eight sewage plants (&lt;em&gt;Chao Yang District Sewage Plant, Qing Yuan Sewage Plant in Chen Hai, Shantou Nan Qu Sewage Plant, Shantou Bei Zhou Sewage Plant, Xia Shan Sewage Plant in Chao Nan District, Hou Jiang Sewage Plant in Nan’ao, Gu Rao Sewage Plant in Chao Yang District, Liang Ying Sewage Plant in Chao Nan District&lt;/em&gt;) are under construction and expected to be completed around 2010, according to the news on Shantou Governmental Website, October 6th, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Shantou Daily in an article published on Mar. 22, 2005, about 1 million people in Shantou didn’t have access to clean drinking water. Chen smiled at that number and said, “If this is the current situation, maybe the citizens will rebel against us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added, “We are making efforts all the time and now about several hundred thousand more people have access to tap water. And we are going to complete the tap water project in 2010.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, a new Water Pollution Control Act in China added water conservation as part of the government’s official goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin’s husband, who refused to give his name, remains skeptical. He said, “Maybe it will have some effect, but as long as their aim for GDP growth is much more important than their handling of pollution issues, change will be slow to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;water-rice&quot;&gt;Water Rice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By Huang Xiao Qing)Lai Han Sheng, a farmer from Lai Cuo Villiage in Shantou, is transplanting his rice seedlings alone into his wet rice field on the afternoon of March 22, 2009. “Farming is not the only source of livelihood for the villagers. It can’t make a good living. The young, therefore, prefer to raise goose or work outside the village rather than farm,” he said. According to the local farmers, a total of 350-500kg rice can be produced from each mu of land, earning between 700 to 1000RMB. However, the rice fields demand hard work. To water their fields, they need to pump water from the river. They use fertilizers as well and don’t have enough money to pay for machines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Disregard for Water Conservation, Despite Shortage</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-people-disregard-water-saving-despite-shortage.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Ding Li (Jasmine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nipic.com/zhuanti/1326875_150.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/829E69FA-766B-4D67-AA3D-A71D28C251DC.png&quot; alt=&quot;water saving&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the persistent sound of running water knocking at the board, a mother holds her temper while trying to persuade her teenage son to open the door and stop his bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode from a Chinese television program on people’s daily lives focused on the conflict between mother and son because of water. The mother had lived through droughts while her son has never experienced water shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have never suffered from a water shortage, and naturally, we show little concern about it,” said Zou Hong, a print shop master around the Golden Phenix Altar of Shantou. His father, Zou Ying Cheng, sitting nearby, nodded in agreement. The print shop master lives with his parents, his wife, and their three children. His family migrated here from Hunan Province in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family’s water consumption is about 35 yuan per month, which means they consume about 24 tons of water, that is, 114 liters a day per person. It is far less from the provincial average level of 214 liters a day per person, according to the statistics from Guangdong Province’s government report on water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou’s water price for living water is 1.45 yuan per ton, with no change in the last ten years, according to the data provided by the native Water Conservation Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the print shop owner’s eye, everyone uses a lot of water, and rarely is conscious of saving water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public service advertisements, the foundation of water-saving weeks are not always enough to curb people’s water consumption. Even the rise in water price seem unable to arouse people’s awareness about water saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zou’s family kitchen is small, barely enough to accommodate three people standing. It is also very wet, with small puddles of water on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is very hard for us to save water, especially when there is a child,” Zou said. He mentioned his first daughter, a primary student in grade two and said that she had learned about saving water at school and even preaches her parents about it, but seldom acts on her own advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During water week, from March 22nd to March 28th, an extension of World Water Day, founded on December 22nd, 1992, Shantou Water Conservation Bureau will organize different kinds of activities like making propagandas in schools and set up public advertising scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People circle round the activity center, looking at the different posters, writing down their names to vow to save water, and then step away,” said Li Qi Qiang, a beggar who has witnessed similar activities in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even the price is doubled, it has little impact with our lives,” Zou said. For him, a doubled water price only means an extra 35 yuan a month. While for Li, the man who lives from begging, that difference in price is very large. Li lives with his grandson, with a consumption of water of two yuan per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We save water as we can,” he said. His house is not neat, with dusty walls hung with kinds of papers, but contrary to Zou’s house, it is very dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few Shantou residents realize the declining of water resources in their areas, though they know it used to rain from the beginning of spring festival and through to the Tomb-sweeping Day in April. But until the end of February this year, little rain has fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People use more water every day, according to the statistics on water consumption published by the provincial government. From 1997 to 2004, the daily household water use per capita increased by 33.4%, while the consumption of water by industries and agriculture descended by 30.7% and 3% respectively. Skills of irrigation and industrialization can help reduce water consumption in industry, but people have to change their attitude and habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Three Defense Bureau, who is in charge of protecting against floods, typhoons and storms, 12 cities in Guangdong Province are now experiencing a light drought, which has affected the amount of drinking water of 124,500 people, because of the decreasing amount of precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou, together with its neighbors, is now taking measures to regulate the timetable of operating the reservoir and the hydropower station to ensure people have enough water, the bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pollution Imperils Fishing Industry in Shantou&quot;s Main Bay</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/pollution-imperils-fishing-industry-in-shantous-main-bay.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s 3:30am, Li Zebin, a fisherman in Haimen Bay, gets up and looks at the sky. Shining stars and a gentle breeze indicate that it will be a good day for fishing. But the bad smell in the air is a bad sign. He drives his little boat among water lettuces, the symbolic plant of contaminated water. In the dim light of his hand-held lamp, he can’t even see the edge of these plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/A267D852-15FA-419F-BC3F-54370FFDB1F2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A267D852-15FA-419F-BC3F-54370FFDB1F2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a two-hour’s trip to the fishing area. Actually, it has become impossible for him to catch any sea food in the bay near Shantou. Severely polluted water has driven all fish stocks into sea area far away. Even shrimp that feed on waste can’t live in a two-mile radius from the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haimen Bay in Shantou, which connects to South China Sea, has been ranked as one of the top national fishing bays of China and the third biggest fishery in Guangdong province. More than 20 thousand people live on fishing and marine aquaculture here. And the famous abalone culture bases offer some of the most expensive sea food to all over the country. According to the plan of Shantou government, it will be the national key fishing harbor in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sewage and industrial waste from the Lian River has put this bay into danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will face the dilemma that  we are building a national key fishing bay but there are no fish in it,” said Dong Jialan, a representative of People’s Congress in a recent political meeting in Shantou. “The toxic water of Lian River has seriously destroyed the marine recourses and environment of Haimen Bay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lian River ranks a number five on the pollution scale, the most polluted rank according to national standards of water quality. The river has no creatures, no self cleaning capacity, and can not be used either for domestic water supply or irrigation. According to the report of ocean environment quality from Shantou Government in 2007, Haimen Bay is the most polluted body of water in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/D1A5DBA3-4B63-49A4-92E7-9C12463025A5.png&quot; alt=&quot;D1A5DBA3-4B63-49A4-92E7-9C12463025A5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soa.gov.cn/hyjww/ml/yhzl/lq/shantou/webinfo/2008/05/1210062821846312.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the website of State Oceanic Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the main pollution source of Haimen fishing harbor, Lian River began to have a water quality problem in the 1990s. Hundreds of township enterprises and family factories discharge the wastewater without any treatment into river channel. And the main industries in Lian River’s basin are regarded to be the most polluting ones, such as printing and dyeing industry, electronic waste disassembly industry and pharmaceuticals industry. But booming factories are eager to have more labor. Consequently, more people produce more untreated sewage that pours directly into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/022D91A6-3C7A-4BBD-A935-E73B3611847B.png&quot; alt=&quot;022D91A6-3C7A-4BBD-A935-E73B3611847B&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lian River taken from the Haimen Brake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garbage and sewage of Haimen town also pour into the sea directly. Tons of garbage carpet the sea wall with a pungent smell. Yellow, green or black water gush out from more than 20 draining exits on the sea wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it rains, Haimen Brake, which controls the flow of water from the Lian River into the bay, will open. The water of the Lian River changes the color of water in the bay from yellow-green to black immediately. Water lettuce fills the surface of the gulf. All marine lives die in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t fish on rainy days for safety in the past,” said Li Zeibin, “But now, we don’t fish on rainy days because there aren’t any fish at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even on this sunny day, Li has to drive his little boat for more than one hour to catch Bombay ducks – a kind of lizardfish – and shrimps. He puts down his fishnet with more than 2 kilometers length and waits for 6 hours to drag it up. Around his boat, nearly 100 fishing boats are waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today is not bad,” Li said and picked up all fishes and shrimps carefully. Only veteran fishermen can find the small sea food from the huge net. The picking-up work takes three hours. Catches are sold to fish mongers on the price of 0.2 yuan per kilogram for Bombay ducks and 1.5 yuan per kilogram for shrimps. In this “not bad day”, Li get two baskets of fishes and half basket of shrimps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People working on bigger fishing boats are also having a difficult time due to the pollution of Haimen Bay. They have to drive one day to the deep ocean compared with eight hours ten year ago. In recent years, some ships even go to ocean area near Taiwan. Ships stay at sea for one week or a-half of a month. If they have to come back earlier due to bad weather, the cost of oil will take most or all of the money that they’ve earned from fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I began to fish in the small boat when I was 12 years old and became the youngest captain on big boat at sixteen,” said Zheng Qingzhou, a 56 year old man, “Now I have gone back to my small boat and will stay till I die.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zheng sold his big boat ten years ago because it is too risky to fish far away from the bay. Traditional wooden boats can’t survive any storms in deep ocean area. And with the decline of fishery resources in China’s waters, more and more fully mechanized fishing vessels from Fujian province have joined the groups of long- rang fishing boats. There have been more than 100 ships from Fujian province called at Haimen for resupply since 2006. More advanced guide system helps them to fish on foggy days, which makes the competition with local fishermen more intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Half of the local big ships don’t go out anymore,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;said Zheng Jin, an official of Fishing Management Office in Haimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the months after April, the pollution situation gets worse due to weather changes and fishing rules. Rainy season comes followed by the fishing ban period, which lasts from July to August. Even in early March, rumors had spread among residents. They believed that the coming fishing stop period would start a-half of month ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fishing Management Office in Haimen confirmed this rumor and professed that the governments would issue subsidies like before. According to the office, the compensation of last year was 800 yuan and 10 to 25 kilograms of rice and a bottle of cooking oil for each boat in fishing ban period. But fishermen here never received or heard of any subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With worsening pollution affecting the financial situation of fishermen, the relationship between local government and fishermen has become tense. On the 23rd of March, nearly 400 petitioners demanded fuel that had been promised by central government.Again, they didn’t get any reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing will stop early this year. But pollution won’t. Continuous raining makes more sewage and rubbish from Lian River pour into sea farming bases in Haimen Bay. Fishes in their mating season die in a large groups during rainy season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“More than 40 families lost nearly 10 million Yuan because of the death of fish during past few years,”said Dong Jialan, referring to fish farming families. As a representative of Shantou, she has paid attention to the pollution in Haimen Bay for more than 10 years and has often discussed the serious situation with local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She received promises and a plan in 2006 to solve the pollution problems, but is still waiting for the promised money and acts that would make the plan real. She suggested opening the Haimen gate to speed the water flow. Faster water flow will help the river to recover its self-clean capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sessions of Guangdong province in March, several representatives of NPC and 15 representatives of CPPCC demand more aggressive policies from provincial government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the younger generation of Haimen can’t wait. All of them went out to work, left the traditional fishing skills and lives behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There will not be fishermen after people in my generation die,”said Zheng Qingzhou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Young Women Take On a New Character in Chao Opera</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-girls-study-male-character-in-chao-opera.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Catherine, Photo by Zanith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl is practising in Tanzi course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One! Two! Three! Four!” A man’s deep voice started to echo as usual at half past two on a sleepy Thursday afternoon. Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan hurried forward to the training classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fastening their shoelaces, binding their belts and tying up their hair, the two five-foot six-inch tall girls, the only girls studying to be a male character in the entire Shantou Arts and Traditional Opera School, were ready for their Chao Opera class seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing the opposite gender in Chinese opera is not news. But among young people studying Chao opera in this generation, more girls are playing male roles now, especially the Chao opera character “Sheng,” a male character known for his bravery or knowledge. The fact that more  females are playing Sheng characters reflects the difficulties in carrying on the traditional opera culture. Low salaries and the aging of the audiences are problems of Chao Opera nowadays. Schools also have fewer and fewer male students, as young men seek more lucrative careers. Female students are filling the gap left by the lack of male students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most girls, playing male characters is a “part time job” ; however, Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan are specializing in Sheng, an unusual field of study for such young women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many characters in Chao Opera. It has several standard characters played in each performance: Dan, Sheng, Jing and Chou. Dan is beautiful girl classified into several roles, for example: Guimen Dan, Hang Dan, Zheng Dan and Huashan. Sheng is the name for a kind of male character, which is divided into Wen Sheng and Wu Sheng. Wen Sheng is handsome and knowledgeable while Wu Sheng is brave and good at fighting. Up to now , actresses playing Sheng character have focused on Wen Sheng. But they still need to learn whirling, jumping and fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;photo-video&quot;&gt;Photo Video&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://player.youku.com/embed/XNDU2NTM3MTIw&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chao Opera is a characteristic ancient local opera. Based on the Yellow River which separates China into northern part and southern part, the various China folk opera types are divided into northern type and southern type. Beijing Opera is one of the northern types, while Chao Opera is a member of southern types. As a brand of Southern drama, Chao Opera flourished in the period around the end of Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of Ming Dynasty, at least 722 years ago. The appearance of this style of drama put Chinese drama into the same league as some of the great drama systems of the world, such as those in India and Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One! Two! Three! Four!” teacher’s voice continued ordering the mechanical rhythms.  Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan started to press their legs on a wooden handrail. They pushed their faces to touch their knees hard with a repeating rhythm which they had already got used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the second year of their Chao Opera studies.  Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan get up for training at six o’clock everyday, they train at least five hours each day for the opera but also study more conventional subjects for four hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chao Opera’s history appeals to numbers of enthusiasts and researchers. But the reason for Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan choosing learning Chao Opera is actually having no relation to Chao Opera history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was not doing well of my study in normal schools,” Zheng Yuezhi gave a stretch and said, “And my mom enjoys watching and listening Chao Opera, especially the Sheng character. So I chose this specialization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She regarded learning Sheng character of Chao Opera is the outlet for her future. Also she considered being a Sheng to repay her mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Zeng Chuxuan, the appeal of performing was linked to portraying a member of the opposite sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s cool to be an attractive and charming man on stage,” Zeng Chuxuan said. Different from Zheng Yuezhi, Zeng Chuxuan’s purpose was simpler. Despite doing well in junior school, Zeng Chuxuan’s deep love of Chao Opera made her quit the common road of the majority kids. In the last summer of 16, she finally successfully persuaded her parents and arrived at the Shantou Arts and Traditional Opera School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a Sheng Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan need to take Tanzi course. Tanzi course is a basic skill course, which aims to improve Sheng students’ flexibility and teach them how to do cartwheeling, jumping, fighting and other physical skills in Chao Opera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills seemed a little bit tough for girls. Despite physical disadvantages, girls do have some advantages to learn Sheng. Huang Youde, the teacher of Tanzi course introduced the advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“First is their flexibility,” He said, “Then is their voice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Beijing Opera which is sung by falsetto, Chao Opera is sung in natural voice. All Chao Opera are in the melody of F key. It’s a little bit high for normal boys’ natural voice, while it’s easy for the majority of girls. Girl who learn to be a “Sheng” character only need to train their voices to be more resonant. But boys have to work harder on the premise of having a beautiful voice. Besides, girls will look more handsome after makeup. Meanwhile, girls are considered to be fit for Wen Sheng’s elegant character and temperament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Though girls may sing and look more beautiful than boys,” Huang Youde said and glimpsed at the two ladies who were practicing hard at the other corner, “But if there were enough boys we would stick to use boy Shengs. Actually, we are in a difficult time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chao Opera needs more potential students” Huang Youde continued speaking, “In order to find potential students the school needs to enroll a big number of kids then select from it. And technically speaking, to choose a boy Sheng is harder than to choose a girl Sheng.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nowadays, fewer kids choose to study Chao Opera as their major, especially boys. In Shantou Arts and Traditional Opera School, there are 280 students now studying Chao Opera. 2/3 is girls while the other 1/3 is boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons is that the market is narrowed down. Further more, Chao Opera artists’ salary is lower than other industries. The main market of Chao Opera is basically people in countryside and people who are older than 40-year-olds in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If a student who just graduate from school can earn 1000RMB/month, he should be very joyful,” said Huang YouDe. “Normally speaking, 700 RMB to 800 RMB is the salary average per month.” But according to the statistics, monthly personal income average of Guangdong province is around 1300RMB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“800 is enough,” Zeng Chuxuan said, “Not a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these two young girls do not care about the conditions. More than considering career and future, Zheng Yuezhi and Zeng Chuxuan said they were focusing on the joys of their work. Despite all that outer conditions, the two girls have discovered that specializing in the “Sheng” character has brought them at least one obvious advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once my friends were bullied by boys, I will help.” Zheng Yuezhi stood up akimbo with an angry face and roared suddenly: “Wang Jin Long, you’re a playboy!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her voice shocked students around. Then there was a roar of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a line in the opera we recently rehearsal called Mei Ting Xue,” Zheng Yuezhi giggled, “Scared, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taxis Face Challenges from Bargaining Culture and Illegal Cars</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/taxis-face-challenges-from-bargaining-culture-and-illegal-cars.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Shirley Xue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnwest.com/content/2008-11/22/content_1568274.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/001372d8a3e00a91914117.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;taxi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;photo from news.cnwest.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing a man in the late 20s walking out of Shantou Bus Transportation Center, Zhang Xiaosong and three other taxi drivers rushed to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you want a taxi? Use the meter?” those four drivers asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I prefer bargaining. How much to the airport?” the man answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“40 yuan,” said Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“25 yuan, OK?” the man asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you kidding? For such a distance, gas costs more than 25 yuan,”said Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After bargaining for about three minutes, these two hadn’t made a deal. Finally the man went away, leaving Zhang Xiaosong to wait for another passenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxi drivers like Zhang are struggling in an economy that is poor and where the long-established habit of bargaining drives down profits. Drivers are often caught between the rules – which require using the meter – and customers, who know they can haggle for a better price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a high number of illegal private cars and off-the-books taxis compete with legal taxis in Shantou, where elicit licenses can be purchased for a half or a third of legal ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have been a taxi driver in Shantou for 14 years. Bargaining is a hidden rule of taking taxis in this big modern city,” said Zhang, a 40-year-old driver from Shangqiu, Henan.”I prefer to use meter because I can earn a little more. However, if you refuse to bargain, there are so many taxis or even illegal ones waiting,” said Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Path Transportation Management Rule issued by China in 1997 ordered taxis to use meters. However that law is rarely enforced in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to improve their image and better their business, on February 20th, 50 representatives of the local main taxi companies signed an agreement in Shantou Bus Transportation Center, saying Shantou taxi drivers would use the meters and never cheat passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any trip around Shantou is often done off the meter. Taxi drivers going to and from the airport said that they did not use meters. They said they only took about two passengers a day because there weren’t so many flights in Shantou. “We should ask a little more to pay for our meals and support our lives,” said they.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some customers feel that bargaining is the only way to ensure a fair price, as some drivers may tamper with meters or use roundabout ways of getting to a destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know why the rate increases so quickly in Shantou. Maybe the driver traveling the farthest way or as someone said, they add accelerators to the meter,” said Wang Zhou, a Guizhou native who was cheated out of 10 yuan the first time she took a taxi here. After that, Wang said she accepted that she had to bargain to get a fair price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that many reasons made bargaining so popular in Shantou, Shantou’s economy contributed the most. Little passengers and a number of competitors forced the taxi drivers to bargain and earn less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of original Special Economic Zones of People’s Republic of China, special policy for Special Economic Zone made Shantou’s smart people very rich for a moment. Now there are 100 thousand cars here which means every 100 citizens owns 26.28 cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the director of Shantou Transportation Association Taxi and Car Department, Li Changshun, in Haojiang, Shengping and Longhu only 4% of local people (1,420,000 in total) and 8% of migrants (230,000 in total) would choose to take taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Shantou was most famous for its illegal-based development, for example smuggling, corruption and fake goods. The magazine Nan Feng Chuang even wrote an article about Shantou’s economy, saying it was kind of “black and not healthy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, illegal cars that carry passengers are a problem in Shantou. Only handing 800 yuan every month to some government officials secretly, those private or scrapped cars can work as taxis and earn money without licenses, according to a report in Nanfang Daily newspaper. However, the fee that legal taxi should hand is 1700-2400yuan every month, depending on which taxi company a driver works for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, illegal taxis had been a big challenge for legal taxis like Zhang. Now Shantou only has 1233 legal taxis. Last year before the strike of taxi drivers in November, when more than one thousand taxi drivers stopped working to protest illegal taxis, illicit cars and taxis were at least three times than legal ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the government punished some illegal taxis in December, there are still about 2000 illegal taxis, including 1000 private cars, according to Li Changshun, the taxi association director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know there are still many illegal taxis and it’s hard for us to compete with them. We have to hand 200 yuan every day to our firm no matter how much we earn (It called Fenzi money. If you hand in, you can use the car for 12 hours) and they needn’t,” said a driver from Dalian Taxi Company who declined to give his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I earn about 2000 yuan every month and it just makes ends meet,” said Zhang. Until 11:30am, this Henan driver hadn’t got even one passenger and he had to pay two yuan for parking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to do business,” Zhang sighed. Standing near his car, this guy kept on waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Water Shortages Make Migrant Life Tougher</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/water-shortages-make-migrant-life-tougher.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dark clouds were getting thicker, and the wind blew strongly. The dusky sky was like the face of a blue man. Finally, the thunder roared. It began pouring. Linghui Jiang quickly put a bucket and a big washbowl in front of her shabby wooden shed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About one hour later, the rain stopped. Not far away from Jiang’s house, the road along Hunan Village was flooded. Jiang, 28, took out the laundry and began to do her washing with the rainwater she just saved. Ever since her arrival from Hunan Province about a month ago, she has been suffering from water shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The water pipes were broken. The boss (the way the workers call the local owner of the fields they rent) thought it would cost him too much to fix it,” said Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Xiushi, a pig farmer in the village voiced her own thoughts, “As immigrant workers from other provinces, we don’t have many choices and can’t complain too much. Our lives are meant to be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the Shantou Funeral Home along Daxue Road, live about 200 immigrant workers and their families. At first several migrant workers from Hunan rented the field from the local owners and built their wooden sheds. As time passed, more and more workers came to rent the fields and build houses. Soon the place became known as Hunan Village in reference to the province where the majority of the workers come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiang came here with her parents and two children of nine months and two years. Jiang sends the elder one to a kindergarten near the village. Jiang’s father is a garbage and scrap collector and goes out everyday. Her mother works in the hospital downtown as a cleaner. Jiang stays at home to take care of the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiang rented the simple wooden shed built by her predecessor from the local owner for 100 RMB for six months. It is an unofficial deal and there is no contract saying that the landlord must guarantee water supply. Many of the other villagers have working water but Jiang’s landlord, she said, thought fixing the problem was too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had no other choice. I need a place to settle down. If I did not rent this house, others would. It’s hard to find one,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiang’s is not the only one family that has no running water. Her neighbor Qin Dongyu suffers the problem much longer than Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We use a little more than half a bucket of water to bath. Sometimes, two people have to share a bucket of water,” Qin said,also from Hunan. She came here four years ago. Now she makes her life on picking scraps and selling them to the recycling station. Her running water stopped one year ago and she was required to pay about 200 RMB for her landlord to solve the problem. Qin refused to pay. “I have been used to the hardship,” the 67-year-old woman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually they need to go out for water every two days. They get water in one of two main ways. They can go to their neighbors who have running water and get some for free. They also can take a few empty plastic containers with a capacity range from 30 liters to 70 liters with them when they go out to pick, sort and then sell the garbage or recycled materials. On their way back, they get water at the recycling station for free and take the water home with bicycles. The way back from the recycle station generally takes them half an hour. If someone else’s water pipes are broken, they can take advantage of it to get water. After collecting water they store the water in vats and wash bowls and cover them. In Jiang’s house, three small wash bowls and one big one (about 60 liters), a ceramic vat and three plastic buckets (all about 80 liters) are used to store water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t complain that it’s the boss’s fault,” Jiang said. “He doesn’t have the responsibility to ensure our water demand. His renting the place to us for so cheap is good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has to decrease the amount and cherish every drop of water. When washing clothes, she won’t refresh the water until she finishes washing all the clothes. Because Jiang’s mother works in a hospital downtown, sometimes she takes their laundry to the hospital and washes them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The families who have running water are struggling to pay extra fee. According to the website of the Shantou running Water Company, the water price given by the government is 1.45 RMB per cube (1000 liters), whereas, villagers must pay for their bosses from about 2.5 RMB per cubic meter to 3 RMB per cubic meter (depending on the landowners). A family with four people needs to pay about 60 RMB every month. And if the water is charged according to the official price, a family can at least save 24 RMB per month, a small fortune to the migrant workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiaojia Wang is one of those who have running water supply. Because the water price is not cheap, she and her family use water frugally. “Except for the water we use to bathe and wash dishes and clothes, we collect almost all the other water we have used for daily life and use it to feed pigs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the village, some workers make their lives on feeding pig. Xiushi Wang is one of them. He feeds about 30 pigs. He has just sold 16 pigs which he has fed for nine months to a local abattoir and earned 4,000 RMB. On average, he makes about 450 RMB per month. Cooking feedstuff for pigs requires a lot of water. Instead of using running water, he dug a well, like other pig farmers, to use underground water. Because the Hunan Village is located near a big fish pool, they have enough water to feed pigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the villagers don’t expect too much that the water problem will be solved quickly, they still have faith. “The government is burying the big fish pool besides our village. Buildings will be built later. As the development of it, the water problem may be solved,” said Qin Dongyu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, another more serious problem may arise-the families may be dislocated to give room to new developments. Jiang has experienced that. Because of the development of the place she used to live, her house is on the list of the rebuilding. “We can do nothing about it. If the government asks us to leave, we surely have to find other places.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou&quot;s drainage system no match for big rain</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantous-drainage-system-no-match-for-big-rain.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=kn42WLyGH3DDIVUV90xMuZPoxwPbp1lC9sZXFf61b26BzVacVrvHkr1c-mZ6puXn5dk85WXt5f0kGNHcML6Dq9SVIwhq4S3huDYaOnxN-3NBld0_cBoxupUJ7YQrA4LEZLD6YZuC2qzicO2Hd2UceMnfPCtNcBGQZ7sN8mXWOAK&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/2016-03-07-上午10.28.07.png&quot; alt=&quot;floody&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;photo from baidu.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Changping Road was floody after heavy rain photo from http://myshantou.net)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When heavy rain falls on Shantou, part of the traffic is paralyzed. The drainage system can’t work well. Rainwater mixed with sewage floods the roads, the traffic stops, and the lives of many people living in areas of low elevation are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I moved here in the late of 1980s. Since then, I have had to worry about big rains when the rain seasons come or thunderstorms arrive,” said Huang Chun Hao, a shopkeeper selling electrical devices for household in Hua Wu street. During heavy rainfall at night he does not sleep. He worries about his belongings and whether he needs to move them up to a higher floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou was a coastal city, facing the South China Sea, with plenty of rainfalls every year, but sometimes the gift of water turns into a nightmare for Huang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rain seasons here last several month, from April to September, when storms constantly hit. The situation become worse when you are living in one of the lowest parts of the city and the drainage system can’t work well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the shelves in Huang’s shop have an extension of 20 centimeters long. “The shelves are specially made in order to prevent the devices are inundated,” said Huang. In order to decrease the loss, Huang also keeps some buckets prepared on the first floor to take water out of his shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has lived in Hua Wu street for over 15 years and got used to the situation. But life is improving. In the last two years, the drainage system on Shan Zhang Road has improved and bigger pipes replaced the old narrow ones. They often get clogged and, as a result, break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to several residents in Hua Wu street, the water’s depth can reach up to one meter or more in a short time. As soon as heavy rainfall arrives, they have to stop working because the traffic stops. No one goes out to shop or do any other business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Shaolin, runs a clothing shop for over 10 years in the Walking Street, an area at a higher elevation than Huang’s home. Although the rain brings less damage, she said, “The whole family won’t sleep if a big rain comes, in preparing to move clothing to a safe place.” Her shop does not have a doorstep and is lower than street level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Walking street drainage system is now being upgraded, to be replacing by bigger pipes. That will ease the pressure of the drainage system here, but on the contrary, that of in the Hua Wu street will bear even more pressure. All the water come from the higher place in the future will run through the small and old pipe in Hua Wu street, according to Huang.&lt;br /&gt;
The Shantou Facility Repairing and Arranging Bureau is in charge of the drainage system of the city. Zheng Junran, a bureaucrat there, said his office had not found any problems with the drainage in Hua Wu street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Last time, we did a research there. But I didn’t find the situation you said in Hua wu street,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Upgrading drainage system is a big project. Every year, we just have a budget of 2 or 3 million (yuan). Until now, our Bureau doesn’t have any special plan to upgrade the drainage system in Hua Wu street, “ Zheng said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pollution threatens eco-tourism in Niutianyang</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/pollution-threatens-eco-tourism-in-niutianyang.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mafengwo.cn/i/1056251.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/wKgB3FChtZeAZPqzAA07I3suB_A92.groupinfo.w680.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;niutianyang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;photo from mafengwo.cn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Caixia was processing parts of toy truck in a small, shabby bungalow, while her 6-year-old daughter and husband were carrying dozens of wet griddles to a barnyard to be dried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past ten years, they have been hired to look after a fish pond in Niutianyang of about 6 hectares. Water quality, however, has affected the quantity of their catch especially for the more sensitive crabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It does not really matter, and I don’t care so much about the water,” said Lin’s husband, Lin Yingshu. “Fishes and shrimp can adapt to dirty water easily. Crabs, however, cannot survive. Five or six years ago, every hectare could yield 40,000 kilos more, but last year, it was 22,000 kilos per hectare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niutianyang is located in the western part of Shantou, along the coast with about 1,300 hectares of fish ponds looked after by about 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niutianyang was land reclaimed from the sea in 1962. But it is more famous because of a typhoon disaster, in 1969, when more than 470 soldiers died in efforts to protect the area and people. The government has built a monument to attract tourists and commemorate their bravery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people come here to enjoy eco-tourism. Wang Yu comes here and pays a fee to fish and bring home whatever he catches. “I always drive here to fish, sometimes with my family,” Yu said. “Niutianyang is wonderful to fish. It is quiet and relaxing. Besides, the fish here are much better than in the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water mainly comes from the sea without any process of purification. According to Lin’s husband, two years ago, a steel plant was built on another bank of the sea. It poured its waste water into the sea, consequently, polluting the same water that goes into the fish ponds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see, our crabs are still fresh without any smell. So there is no need to purify the water, maybe the water became clear again,” said Lin. “The water in the downtown is much worse than the water here. So our fish is better than fish in other places of Shantou.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the water is polluted, so will be the fish. If the fish is polluted I would rather buy it in the market. Sometimes, the fish here is getting a little smelly,” Yu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Tuojiang and Rongjiang river are major rivers that cross Shantou. Both of them have been severely polluted, and lead into the sea of Shantou. This is another cause of the pollution of sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tourism administration, however, said there was no pollution in the sea near Niutianyang. “The water there is OK, We have never heard about the pollution of the sea.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cleaning Efforts of Longhu Canal Threatened</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/cleaning-efforts-of-longhu-canal-threatened.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gdlonghu.gov.cn/Gb/Home/Details.aspx?CateID=002030&amp;amp;ID=15051&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/20130412105432_2500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;longhu canal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;photo from gdlonghu.gov.cn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the junction of Huanghe Road and Jinghuannan Road, the water of the Longhu Canal stands still with litter on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little over a year ago, the intense cleaning up of the 7.3 kilometer-long canal was complete.&lt;br /&gt;
However, the renovated Longhu Canal is now facing menace. The more visitors it attracts, the more garbage it accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Humans always bring pollution,” said Fang Sheng, a resident near Longhu Canal. As one of the residents who lived in the area for over 20 years, he witnessed the time before Longhu Canal was cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was smelly in the past years, the water was very dirty, and the waterspout was jammed. When it rained, it always brought troubles, like flooding,” he said. “Now it is much better since it has been treated, no smelly wind, and I always come here to wander along the ditch or do exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longhu Canal was originally used as an irrigation ditch for farmland. However, as the city expanded so did the number of people living near the canal. More and more apartment and commercial buildings were built. Industry and business also flourished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a Shantou Daily article at the time, the town clerk and city government decided to renovate the ditch in 2003. On December 31, 2003, the repairing work formally began. The main measure was to use the water from Hanjiang River to swell out the polluted water. After four years, in January 2008, the ditch was clean of garbage and sewage. The city government also built other structures like the green belt with road lights and benches, to make the canal more attractive. The project cost over 14.8 million RMB, according to a government website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cui Yi, 68, is one of the visitors, came from Shandong province. She came to Shantou to visit her daughter who has been teaching in Shantou. Cui has no job and a lot of free time, so she always goes to Longhu Canal to find someone to talk to. She has been living in Shantou for three months, and goes to the canal every afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ditch is long and beautiful, but there is so much litter on the surface,” she said.&lt;br /&gt;
“Why do they throw litter into the ditch? The government spent so much time and money on renovating it,” she asked no one in particular as she stood on the edge of the ditch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He Dawen, a city official, gave a speech at a government conference in February to draw attention to the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Very few citizens have awareness of hygiene and environmental protection,” said Shantou’s commissar and deputy headmaster of Shantou First Middle School. “They sometimes conveniently throw cigarettes, cartons, plastic and other garbage into the ditch. Moreover, a few small food shops pour the sewage and the waste into the ditch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggested the government strengthen daily management and clean up of the canal.&lt;br /&gt;
However, those in charge of cleaning the canal say there is no regular schedule for clean up. Liao Yao Guang, a worker of the environmental cleaning department said, “the Sanitation Authority would dispatch workers to clean up the canal and the green belt when sanitation workers find it dirty, no stated time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 43-year-old said the cleaning process is not easy, they will fish out the litter on the surface by riding a boat, then they let out all the sewage water, the ditch should be dry up, finally they can fill it up with clean water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We just do the cleaning work, people pollute the water, and we clean it. Maybe the government can take more actions to stop people polluting this ditch,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since He made the suggestion, the authorities have not done any project yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chaozhou Girl to Dance on One of the World&quot;s Greatest Stages</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chaozhou-girl-to-dance-on-one-of-the-worlds-greatest-stages.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/W020090216377227509924.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dancer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 18-year old girl from Chaozhou danced hard, day after day for the 13 years without complaints. A few days ago, the girl, Huang Tonglin was officially chosen to solo dance in Vienna’s Golden Hall, generally considered to be one of the finest concert and performance halls in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a story about her in Da Hua news site, the spring of 2009 was described as a “harvest season” for Huang. She won two world renowned dance awards consecutively over the course of a few days. At the Third World of Chinese Art Festival in January, she won the first prize in Junior B team for her Dai minority dance called “Flying Peacock.” At the Hong Kong International Youth Arts Festival, she won a Diamond Award in the Dance Professional Youth Group on Feb. 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huang began to love dancing when she was in kindergarten, according to her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dance was her best playmate,” her father was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huang passed the entrance exam of Guangdong Dance School and studied in Guangzhou by herself when she was only 14 years old. Her parents opposed her choice at the beginning but she stuck to her dream. Not only was she able to handle herself on her own, but she also accepted strict professional dance training when other children of the same age were still heavily reliant on their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to her training routine, Huang had to stick to a strict diet in addition to accepting the dance training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had to run 5000 meters as a penalty if I was found to have eaten snacks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You practice for ten years off the stage for one minute on the stage,” Huang said. “I would succeed one day, I believed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Zhong Jing Zhen (Tiffany)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When walking across the streets in Shantou, a great many tricycles that have become an exotic feature of this special economic zone will immediately come to your sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them, one stands out much more in an overwhelmingly male gathering, a woman sits on her tricycle waiting for the next customer. Jiang Xia, from Anhui Province, has been carrying passengers around Shantou for almost two decades to support her daughter and two sons with her husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiang Xia from Anhui province, waits to take passengers in her pedicab near Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Actually, I have never thought that I would take up this job,” Xia says. “But it is more than a way to earn my living. It is a chance to realize my dream of being successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aside from being more healthy and strong, my dream to make a living on my own and succeed in my career has come true thanks to my tricycle,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, having been in hospital for two or three months after wounded in a flood in her hometown, she was persuaded by her relatives to leave for Shantou where they work as cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving up the initial idea of selling home snacks near the railway station, she decided to carry passengers by means of a tricycle the moment she saw the handicapped ride on the street one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“However, at the very beginning, the local people looked down upon the tricycles because they considered them as tools for the disabled,” she sighed. “But I have spent more than 1,000 yuan on it. There is nothing to do but work hard on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, her 25-year-old daughter, who is a doctor after graduating from Tsinghua University, asked her to move to Beijing, but she refused to do so. “Naturally, I have been accustomed to the warmth here; more importantly, the local people and government make me reluctant to leave and quit my job here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She should have a brighter future and lead a comfortable life. I do not want her to spend much time and money in taking care of me,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything here reminds me of the touched moment,” she continues, “On New Year’s Eve, a kind-hearted old lady gave me 100 Yuan when I took her home, then she said to me, ‘hurry to go home and spend the New Year with your family,’ Happy tears sprang from my eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, above all, it is the freedom and the sense of achievement that push her to continue her ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyday, I can carry my passengers to their destination safely, like travels, feeling free.” There is no need for her to work in an exact or restricted time because she can adjust the time to her needs and begin during rush hours with respect to being her own boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Also, even though I am not so rich now, I can feed my family by myself!” she says excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in a building in Lane3, Changxia Village, Changxia Road, every day, she gets up early in the morning, prepares the breakfast and does the washing. She begins working after lunch and doesn’t go home until midnight without having dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the People’s Square is not her only choice. It is Wal-Mart, Tuopu, Chenghai, Walking Street and the bus terminal station that she will wait for more customers every day. “To be honest, I feel very, very thirsty during my busy rides, especially in the summer days. So, two bottles of medicinal herbal tea are necessary for me. They make me energetic!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike others, she keeps on carrying passengers to the destination in spite of the strong wind and the heavy rain, without more fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though sometimes a few unreasonably troublesome passengers complain that the seat makes them uncomfortable, or lose their temper with her, she never utters a word. “The customer is God, of course!” As a result, her responsible attitude increases the loyalty of passengers to her. A few regular customers keep on using her rather than others when they saw her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am satisfied with my current income 30 or 40 Yuan a day, more than 10,000 Yuan a year that at least is affordable to support my whole family,” she says with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every time the traffic policemen confiscate our tricycles, the governmental officials do us a favor and return them to us.” A smile passes across her rubicund face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she admits, with a grin, she will go back to her hometown to operate a snack bar in several years, maintaining her dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, she operates the engine, pedals her tricycle and carries her passenger ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-woman-pedicab-driver&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Woman Pedicab Driver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Bi Qianyi (Suzy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green pedicabs stand in a long row outside the entrance of Wal-mart, a shopping mall in the center of downtown Shantou. When the drivers grab potential guests, they usually shout to them loudly with serious faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the drivers are men, wearing dark grey or white T-shirts, with a pair of sandals. Among this group of men, only a few are women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can handle the pedicab well as men,” said Chen Dongmei, one of the drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dongmei, ties her hair in a ponytail, wears a light blue T-shirt and a pair of sneakers on her feet. Like the other drivers, her skin is swarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 31-year-old from Anhui Province smiles coyly when asked why she came to Shantou. “I have to earn money to maintain my family,” said Chen, whose husband is still farming in Anhui. They have a 9-year-old son and their own aging parents to look after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The money we get from farming is not enough, “ she said. “I’ve never studied at school, so it’s hard to find a better job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did not know what to do until she met her countrymen at the spring festival, who told her that she could earn more money in Shantou by carrying passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen is only about 1.5 meters high. “Of course it’s really hard to compete with those big guys,” she said, holding the handlebar. “You see the row from the front to the back?” she asked, pointing to the long row several meters away from her. “There’s a rule that the one who stands in front of the row has priority to carry guests. I don’t know where that rule is from, but that’s the rule.” Chen does not stand in that row but she is among other driver friends on the corner in front of all men drivers. “I have to do so, or I have no chance to get the guests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two girls came wanting to take a pedicab. Men were shouting, negotiating with girls on the fare. Another woman driver beside Chen said yes to those girls immediately, and got the guests. “We can only get guests by this way, with lower prices,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think they (women pedicab drivers) have the same strength as men,” said Mr. Yu, who is a security guard at McDonald. Everyday when patrolling, he can see pedicab drivers waiting outside McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Li and her younger sister always take a pedicab when they go out. “We prefer woman drivers,” Li’s younger sister said, eating her ice cream. “They are gentler than men, and they will not drive too fast as men do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women customers like me more,” Chen said. “I don’t know, maybe because I am a woman. Sometimes men will get angry with us. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are still some men drivers showing mercy on their women competitors. Mr Jiang, who is also from Anhui, has been a pedicab driver here for three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women doing the same job as us is very hard,” he said, adding he has seen some women unable to handle larger loads of people. “But this doesn’t mean that they are not fit for this job because they are women. Everyone can do a good job as long as he wants to earn money. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen comes here about 8 a.m. from her rented house where she lives with four other women drivers everyday, and doesn’t go back home until 10 p.m. Even though their days are long, the women always find time to talk, so that they can shrug off nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We usually talk about our family when we go back late at night,” Chen said. “I miss my family. I want them to live more happily.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wants to earn at least 20,000 yuan before she can go back to run a small grocery store with her husband and move away from farm life. She calls her family once a week, crying after every call. “But when I am thinking about what I am doing for them, the energy comes back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-women-pedal-a-pedicab-for-life&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A women pedal a pedicab for life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Zhang Xiaomin (Mina)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the San Shen Ren sculpture in Jingxin Road the congested urban areas of Shantou, is a woman who pedals a pedicab, the local word for rickshaw. She sweats of her brow and smiles at the passerby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stopped her pedicab and used her sleeves to wipe the sweat off her face, protected from the sun by a red hat.She looks tall and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman’s name is Li Huaicui, from Anhui province. She said she had been in Shantou three years and does the job more than two years. Since she came to Shantou, she tried to get a job taking care of two children and working at a restaurant, but the money was too low, she said. Pedaling all day in a rickshaw is more painstaking but earns much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My husband fully supports for me on this,” said the 37-year-old. “Now my children are here too, they will go to school, so I must earn more and more money.” She can earn about 40 yuan a day and more during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If there are no passengers, I would feel very tired. When I carry the passengers, though there is pain in my body, I feel very happy,” Huaicui said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huaicui showed the palms of her hands covered in calluses from holding tight and rubbing against the handlebars. She said driving a pedicab is a hard work, but she can do it well. Sometimes being a woman attracts other women to hire her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would tend to hire a woman, because pedicab driver should have rugged physical strength. It is hard for women to do this job. I think (they need) the money is,” said Tan Ling one of Huaicui’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think this woman is from Anhui,” she said speaking to her friend who was also riding with her. “Women from Anhui would be stronger and could endure fatigue or hardships. She must be an Anhui woman, I would bet on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another woman, Zhao Ling from Shantou, said she did not care to sit on a woman’s pedicab or a man’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of this year there were many women who choose women drivers.” At the beginning of the year there was a case where a driver raped and killed a young girl. After the rape case, many women were afraid of the male drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would tend to hire a man,” said Hong Chunjie, a student from Lyhuai High School. “Men have double the speed. All the schoolboys of our class would like to be driven by a man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are more and more women doing this job. It needs physical strength, however, there is no limit of time. If you have a pedicab you may do the job whenever you please. This job is very fit for women which must do housework,” said Fang Zhihua, a male pedicab driver from Jiangxi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Huaicui’s pedicab is not the same as others’. Most pedicabs run by motor but hers has no motor which would cost about 2,000 yuan. “I have never thought of it. It takes too much!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She spent about 1,000 yuan to buy the pedicab without a license plate, because registration would cost 400 Yuan a month. She is afraid that the police will catch her, as they have twice before, and then she would lose her pedicab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, some male drivers said they hate the police but they are not afraid of them at all. “They capture our pedicab in the morning, and we could get it out with about 300 Yuan in the evening,” said Fang Zhihua, 54. The police catch the drivers just to get the bribe money, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are bandits,” said another pedicab driver Zhang Changlian. “It is very unfair to us, but we have no choices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zewei,a most promising student in the diving school, takes every training seriously. He may have a chance to the Guangdong province diving team becoming a full time athlete and dropping out of study. However, if he could not develop himself as a national athlete when he reach 20, he has to leave the team.He may become a coach like his coach. For there are too many retired athletes but few demands for employment, he may find no job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Richest Man in Mainland China under Investigation</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/richest-man-in-mainland-china-under-investigation.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richest Man in Mainland China under Investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huang Guangyu Suspected of Involving in Misappropriation of Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.com.cn/gg/gsxw/201212/t20121220_3787961.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/u3632122721744158385fm21gp0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Huang Guangyu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mingpao.com/&quot;&gt;MingPao&lt;/a&gt;, Huang Guangyu, the founder of Gome Appliances, who tops the latest mainland China rich list, was taken on 20th by the Beijing police on investigation. Sources reveal that Huang Guangyu is involved in a series of economic crime: illegally utilizing a shell company to operate capital, impropriating capital and commiting bribery.                      photo from cs.com.cn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news started to spread in Beijing immediately after Huang was taken on 20th. Some journalists received messages revealing that Huang and Gome’s financial majordomo Zhou Yafei had been taken by the police on 17th. Moreover, Huang’s wife and a main financial staff, both related to many key cases, have run away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gome Vice-president Responds Obscurely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MingPao journalists interviewed the vice-president of Gome Appliances, He Yangqing, in Gome’s headquarter of Beijing. He said that the messages were kind of spite and boredom. This was not a formal channel of information, so Gome won’t show any public respond. He required journalists not to reveal it. In the afternoon, Bossline.com revealed the news. But relevant news in Baidu was blocked in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists can’t get in touch with Zhou Yafei, Gome’s financial majordomo, indicating something unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An informed person said to journalists that Huang would have had an important interior meeting but was taken by the police on 20th. Reasons were unclear. He added that the administration had ordered the staffs not to reveal any information to the public until the matter got clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperators Urge to Settle Accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many factories that cooperated with Gome have issued inner documents, urging to settle the outstanding accounts with Gome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainland websites reported that Gome’s public relation staffs visited the chiefs of some mainland media, hoping not to publicize the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gome was trapped into severe situations this year. Recent years, Gome was active in merger and acquisition to increase its market occupation, spending a mint of money. At the same time, its operating cost soars due to the mounting number of staffs and branches. As the economic crisis took place, Gome’s sale fell sharply while the expense remained high. If this case was verified, cooperation with suppliers would be ended, making the situation worse off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case may be related to the one that happened in 2006, in which Huang Guangyu and his brother Huang Junqin were investigated on illegal loan from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gome, initiated in January 1st, 1987, is the largest consumer electronics appliance retailer in China. Gome has established retail outlets in over 280 cities in mainland China, with over 1200 direct sales stores, more than 200 thousand staffs and famous brands such as Gome, Yongle, Dazhong and Black Swan. Gome opened branches in Hong Kong and Macao respectively in 2003 and 2006, and was listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (0493) in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past ages, saying 1950s to 1990s, the hucksters, peddlers, vendors around the streets and small lanes in downtown in Chaoshan area were widespread and enjoyed great popularity. Their business took an important role in our life. They severed us from selling daily necessary articles to recycling used things, from reparing appliances to offering beauty treatment. Once we felt we could not live without these street services. However, as scores of years went by, most of them have steped down from the history stage. The rest are still struggling to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they has never gone away from our memery. To some extent, they reflected the real life of the Chaoshan people in those ages. In the following, we translated this fabulous description about the former street business with literature and art pictures done by Xiao Sheng, a retired stage designer of the Shantou TV Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recycling scrap metal and toothpaste shell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When go downtown, no matter in main streets or small lanes, we can easily hear the sound “recycling scrap metal, used electric appliances” from the recorder of the hucksters. This reminds me of some other hucksters who were ever quite familiar to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, “recycle scrap metal, used paper and toothpaste shells”, from a long distance, a huckster who was always carrying two wicker Baskets shouted. Then residents might carry out a pile of waste paper and a few toothpaste shells to exchange money. You may wonder why the huckster recycled toothpaste shells. The reason is that toothpaste shells were mainly made of lead, a metal which was short of in that period. In those days, you couldn’t buy a new toothpaste just using money but had to took along with a toothpaste shell as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, however, waste collecting trolley appeared. With this equiment, huckster could collect more scraps and carry them much more easily. At this time, with the development of secondary industry, they could recycle more scrap metal and used paper than ever before. And more people joined this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Huckster had a new equipment. They began to ride a tricycle, by which they could collect and carry wastes easily and quickly. They not only recycled scrap metal and used paper, but used washers and TV sets as well. If you had these things to handle, you just needed to call them, then they would collect these things themselves from yours house. This kind of huckster is still very common in the rural areas now. Nowadays, the huckster wants more things, such as used computers and refrigerators. They use a recorder to do their advertisements instead of shouting out to be heard by themselves.                     (photo from baidu.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facial threading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guokr.com/post/431350/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/yqRY80al8l2RUj9DqNn3hSaYYpAlb3WlMZ_1Wbj605rUAwAAvAIAAEpQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;facial threading&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facial threading, better known to Chinese as “Wan Mian”, is a traditional folk technique of facial hair removal practiced by old or mid-aged women. First, the beautician spreads some white powder on the consumer’s face to reduce the gloss of the fine hair. Then she holds one end of the cotton thread with her teeth and twists it by hands. As the thread, manipulated by her fingers, rolls over the face, the hair is removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the old days, women usually did facial threading when there was a festival, happy event or wedding. Women also chat with each other during “Wan Mian”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foot bucket and waist bucket selling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above talks about the women’s facial threading, now let’s change to the women’s bath equipment: waist bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waist bucket, made of Chinese fir, is an ancient bidet intended for woman to wash under parts of the body. It is about 50cm in diameter and 40cm in height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another kind of popular bucket is foot bucket, also made of Chinese fir and used for bathing and washing clothes. It has about 90cm in diameter and 20cm in height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the foot buckets and waist buckets are sold by the women from Jieyang city. In the picture, a woman, wearing a loose blue hakka dress and golden bamboo hat, is shouting out for consumers, yelling “Foot buckets and waist buckets are sold”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renew bucket bottom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When foot bucket, waist bucket and other wood bucket are used for a long time and impaired, people hire a woodworker to renew the bucket bottom. It’s not an easy job. The woodworker have to join pieces of wood together without using adhesive or nails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a men’s job, for which a man carries a shoulder pole with a wood toolbox in front and a bamboo basket in behind, filled with lumber, saw and a chair, yelling “Have your bucket bottom renewed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past time, it’s common for people in downtown to raise chicken and pigs at home for eggs and the meat used as ancestral sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens hire a castrater to castrate their roosters and pigs, like removing the testicle of the rooster, in order to prevent them from losing weight during the brunst season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The castrater is also a vet for cats and dogs. He always rides a bicycle, attaching different kinds of small knives and pliers to his waist as a characteristic of his identity, traveling around the city streets and looking for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Pen” selling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pen” is the common call for “surambi water” in Chaoshan dialect. “Pen selling” was a familiar calling to many Chaoshan people. Usually in the past years, the “pen” buyers came to take the “pen” early in the morning and their yell “pen selling” broke people’s sleeping dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, peasants, suburbanites and urbanites usually fed pigs, and “pen” was one of the main feedstuffs. Therefore, “pen” became a well-selling stuff. Each family set a jar for pouring “pen”in front of their house to let the buyer take it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers in the 1950s often carried two buckets on a yoke, yelling “pen selling, pen selling” and buying “pen” from the different families.&lt;br /&gt;
(Someone also yelled “buying pen”. Actually, it should have been “buying pen” because the yeller would pay money to buy “pen”. When he called “pen selling”, that meant “come out to sell your pen” in Chaoshan dialect.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s buyers usually rode a bike, with one plastic bucket on each side of the backseat. Those who came to buy “pen” were often acquaintances of the providers, and they often came to buy “pen” at a certain time of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the pig was sold (often called as “marrying pig “), “pen” buyer would bring two pieces of bread, which had been used for worship, to the “pen” sellers. At that time, a family (usually held four or five people) could make one or two cents a day through selling pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Index:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was common to hear and see “drug drum” in the past years. However, this business has gradually disappeared since the 1990s. In the old days, the drumbeat “dohn, dohn, dohn” were usually heard at the breakfast time. That was the pedlar swinging his swinging drum, which was his facia. The words “drug drum” came from “swinging drum”, because both of them share a similar pronunciation in Chaoshan dialect. As a result, people took “drug drum” for “swinging drum” over time and those who swung their drums and sold their wares were often named as “drug drum picul” or “drug drum seller”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “drug drum” seller often carried a fancy wooden container, in which were all the small articles of daily use such as sachets, toilet powder, rouge, “la dao” (It was made of aloe in shape of pieces and used to do up one’s hair. It served as the modern fixtures when it was dipped into water), vanishing creams, soaps, toothpastes, red head ropes, lamp wicks, elastics, needlework and tailor’s chalks. Consequently, women were the main consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another “drug drum seller” came soon after the pedlar turned to the back street. This time, the drum was bigger but less fancy than the former one and gave out a sound like “pu, pu, pu”. He was the “clothes-dyer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of the job and the habit of smoking while working, the hands and chins of the clothes-dyers always had some dyed marks, making themselves very dirty. He carried his stuffs on his shoulder with a shoulder pole, on which one side was a wooden case with kinds of dye stuffs and the other was a bamboo crate with a forging hearth and a pan, yelling “Clothes dyeing” as well as swinging his drum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People usually have their clothes repaired and dyed when they were worn out. Thus, clothes-dyeing became a small business which can serve simply and efficiently just in front of the client’s house by firing up the forging health and starting the dyeing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish sauce and soy sauce selling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At noon, a special small dolly would travel around, with the yelling of “Do you want fish sauce or soy sauce?”. On the dolly sit bottles of fish sauce and soy sauce; also with other two vats of fish sauce and soy sauce which were sold in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people would buy sauce in bulk with their own bottles. The price was counted by cent at that time, but the taste was very delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repair forging hearth or change the windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooker has come a long way, twenty years ago were forging hearth and coal furnace, and now are liquefied petroleum gas cooker and induction cooker. The forging hearth is made of mud, easily to be broken. Thus, repairing them is a common thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was a proper time to repair forging hearth as it would take three to four hours to be dry and wouldn’t delay supper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some repair men would use a dolly; the other would shoulder a bamboo crate, with a pail of mud. The mud is unusual, working as the main material to repair the hearth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repair copper pots, galvanized pots and metal pails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, most daily commodities such as basins, buckets and plates were made of ironware, which were easy to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man pushed a small dolly along the street and yelled “Repair broken pots and pails!” The small dolly was very interesting. Besides some necessary facilities, it also had a small charcoal stove used to burn iron scoop, accompanied with a manual fan. When the swinging the fan, the nice fire leapt out from the stove, very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verdigris Plaster Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer and autumn, it was common to see the “verdigris plaster medicine” seller around the downtown street. The man rode a bicycle with a stick, to which the plaster medicine adhered. In fact, he was a traveling doctor to cure children’s furuncle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man wore big trousers, a broad waist belt, a grass hat and a pair of sunglasses. He slowly cried, “Verdigris Plaster Medicine”, a little mysterious to the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When darkness covered down, various snacks came to the stage: Hou Guo, Gao Shao Bai Guo, Zong Qiu and sticky rice chitterlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every vendor shouldered a dan, held a wind light, travelled around and yelled along the street, except the “Yun Tun” (kind of dumplings) seller, who didn’t cry but played a patter to attract passers while traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;woman-make-shahe-fen-in-tuopu&quot;&gt;Woman make Shahe fen in Tuopu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By He Qianyi (Hazel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small, low, narrow room located in a quiet, dirty street with Chinese old-fashioned houses people lived, Lin Xia is standing near a pan on a fire making Shahe fen, traditional Chinese type of noodle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Xia, makes Shahe fen on the outskirts of the city of Shantou in Tuopu. Just like many women in the metropolitan area, the 40-year-old worked in a clothes factory when she was young. After getting married, Lin quit her job and moved to her husband’s home. She did not stay a housewife for long. She began to take over her husband’s aunt’s business to make Shahe fen. Twenty years later, she is still making and selling her noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shahe fen, noodles made of wheat is especially common among the local Chaoshan People. Many people in Shantou will use Shahe fen as offerings during the New Year and traditional festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Shahe fen is not an easy job. Every day, Lin wakes up at 5 a.m., spending the whole day working in the disorderly room filled with tools and equipment used to make noodles, bags of sawdust to light fires and only one old fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing near the fire where a big round pan is heated, she uses a bamboo stick to take a piece of white, hot paste out of the pan. She rolls the paste around a stainless steel tube. She pours rice milk into the pan to make another paste, then sets the paste aside to cool it down. After the paste cools off, Lin spreads it flat on a large bamboo curved tray with large openings, then folds it into rectangular-shaped pieces. She also has to make sure the fire stays lit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Xia repeats the same procedure day after day, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We had to grind the rice into rice milk ourselves before, but now we can do it by machine. It is much better now,” Lin said. Lin grinds 100 kilos of rice to make rice milk everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The noodles here are the most delicious,” said a little girl who comes here regularly to buy Shahe fen for her family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the development of technology, many cottage industries are replaced by factories. Lin said it’s hard to tell whether hand-made or machine-made is better because different people have different tastes, but she will continue doing this because some people prefer her hand-made food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin spends most of the time alone at her job but sometimes her two 19-year-old sons come to help. “They are not very good at studying but they will come to help in their spare time,” said Lin smiling shyly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will keep doing this job here”, Lin said. “You need money to raise your family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Lu Lisen (RJ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening when the no.6 bus comes to a stop at the “QuanQiuTongDaSha” station, it is 10:30 p.m. A young man, ChenJia, moves his tired body to get onto the bus. The bus engine begins, and the young man looks out the window, as if thinking about something. After a while, he turns his eyes back to look into nothing. The young man sighs, looks spent, but relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChenJia works in a small company named “Xiaofangzhou” that produces video for clients from promotional videos to wedding videos. As a graduate of a three-year junior college, the 23-year-old does not have much to complain about his job, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChenJia doesn’t earn much money, about 800 yuan a month. But that doesn’t matter to him as much as being able to keep the money he earns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s already a good thing that I don’t need their (parent’s) money, they won’t expect me to contribute any money to the family,” he says. The young man has a girlfriend who was his classmate before. They earn a little money, and have their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the only cameraman in the company, much of the responsibility falls on him, although there is another employee learning the craft. Most of the client events are outside the normal working hours, of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Some are soirees or campaigns held in the evening, so he must work late even after working all day. Sometimes the video is on deadline, and he must edit it in the evening so that it can be sent to the client the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The wealthy are having their fun, but you must take a video to film them. And then, you must look at these same scenes many times to edit them,” he says. “It is so crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know my job is tiresome and my labor is so cheap, but I am not afraid of that and I will persist,” the young man says. “I do everything as best as possible. I will work hard with this company. I will grow up with her, then I think I won’t waste my time and effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the window, the colorful light, the happy people playing in the weekend evening, the beautiful scene catches the young man’s eye. He smiles. “I really wish I could take my girlfriend to have a good weekend every week. But, I think, I will have those days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the young man gets off the bus and moves his tired body home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Wu Linling (Warm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tang Yonghua sat on his bike making plaster models on a Saturday afternoon outside the JinSha Park in Shantou while an onlooker showed interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunshine was cut into pieces by the leaves and the buildings that lined the street. Though it was Saturday afternoon, few people were on the street. Tang YongHua was sitting on his bike equipped with materials and tools to make his plaster models. About a dozen people surrounded him and looked intently at what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like doing something like making artwork,” said the 59-year-old, “I feel free and happy when doing this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting on the bike, Tang took out a big bowl and poured some clean water in it, and then poured some blue paint into it to make a more liquid paint. He threw a handful of gesso into the colorful water then used chopsticks to mix. He took up the mash and poured it into a mold then adjusted it carefully to make sure every part of the mold had been filled up. He puts the mold aside and starts another. People surrounding him and his plaster models showed amazement when, 20 minutes later the sculpture comes out of the mold. The onlookers kept asking questions. Tang YongHua was happy to answer and even happier when they pulled out money to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tang makes four kinds of plaster models from 1 Yuan to 8 Yuan and earns about 2,000 yuan a month. Tang makes the plaster models adroitly. He said he can make about 100 of the smallest and about 40 or 50 of the biggest models a day. But he does not sell out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The worst day I had only 12 Yuan income. But the luckiest day I had more than 300 yuan income that was this year’s National Day,” Tang said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He usually goes out at 9 a.m. and back home at 6 p.m. having lunch that he brings from home on the street. On the weekdays, he goes to the schools to sell them and he goes to the shopping district on weekends. He doesn’t go out on rainy days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March last year, Tang YongHua came to Shantou from Chongqing city, Sichuan province. He came to Shantou with his wife to live together with their son, who had been in Shantou for about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are not very rich but I don’t need to go out to make money,” Tang said. “My son asked me to stay home to enjoy a comfortable life with my wife, but I can’t stand not having anything to do except watching TV or sleeping. That is so boring. So I went to find a job and worked as a builder until I came here. Since the work was too hard and I was a little too old, I had to give it up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, he got a job in a toy factory where he became focused on learning how to make toys so that he could make them on his own, he said.&lt;br /&gt;
“As soon as I learn all the skills I needed, I left the factory. From the first day to the last, I stayed in the factory only seven days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as Tang left the factory, he asked a friend he made in the toy factory to give him some rubber. Tang then went to buy some popular toys and some Bodhisattva models, studied their structures and used the rubber to make molds of them. “Not everything went well at the beginning, but I still thought that it won’t be too hard if I keep trying. A few days later, I succeeded. I was so happy,” said Tang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said he didn’t make models when he was at home, but he would spend much time to study all kinds of toys to create new ones. He made friends with two other people who were doing the same thing as him and then learned some skills from each other to improve themselves. But the other two went back to their hometown a few months ago leaving Tang as the only one who made plaster models to sell in this way in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brilliant photos of EGOC Expo Firework</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/brilliant-photos-of-egoc-expo-firework.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As our news team &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.myshantou.net/402.html&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, Shantou just hosted the &lt;em&gt;East Guangdong Overseas Chinese Expo&lt;/em&gt;, which was a remarkable event for the city and East Guangdong region. On my weekly family call, my dad told me it’s to some extend gave a great deal of confidence to Shantou, especially to local business. One of my Canadian friends who is doing business in South China also attended the event, and he told me it’s significant landmark to raise Shantou’s image in both national and international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;There was a firework display at that night and I heard it was very much impressive. I found a set of well taken photos by one of the members (玩美视觉&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;毛衣 ) in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ezeem.com&quot;&gt;Ezeem Forum&lt;/a&gt; “. After granting his permission, I would like to share it here. It’s exciting for me to see such a beautiful night light of Shantou!&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shantou native Huang Songyou has been removed from his post of vice-president of the Supreme People’s Court from the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Oct 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the11th NPC Standing Committee meeting, the decision was announced without saying why the 51-year-old Huang had been expelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a Caijing magazine report said Huang had been involved in the corruption case of Yang Xiancai, former executive director of the Guangdong Provincial High People’s Court, where Huang once worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou University sent seven students to the US to do reports on the Pesidential eletion for three months. They set off from Shantou in the mid-August, and returned on Nov.13th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported by Li Ka Shi Foundation and Shantou University, the seven lucky dogs were chosen to report the US presidential election. Most of them have never been to the US and had a tough but fruitful journey there. During the journey, they visited over ten cities and districts, and interviewed people of different races and identities, from the ordinary people to the government officials. Mainly they did the special reports about the two partys’ conventions, the campain activities and the financial crisis. Two of them were even fortunate to have an face-to-face interview with the vice president-elect Joe Bidden.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chaoshan Gains a Thrive Opportunity</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chaoshan-gains-a-thrive-opportunity.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.hqcr.com/projects/news/view.aspx?nid=62575&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/20081112154218.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo from news.hqcr.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaoshan may face with a turning point to bring a bright future in the following years. On Nov.11th at Shantou Universtiy, the 2008 Chaoshan Development Forum began, which invited some academic scholars, Chaoshan Overseas Chinese and government officials from Shantou, Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shanwei, to get together to discuss on the development of Chaoshan area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the indication to stimulate the economy in East Guangdong, from Guangdong Province Government, Chaoshan gains a good opportunity. In Sepdember of 2006, Guangdong Province Government officials held a meeting in Shantou, talking about the development in East Guangdong, and finally produced a file which planned to hold a regular “Overseas Chinese Exposition”in Chaoshan, aim at encouraging the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese to come back and support the hometown development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this first “Overseas Chinese Expostion”(see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.myshantou.net/397.html&quot;&gt;First East Guangdong Overseas Chinese Exposition&lt;/a&gt;), the 2008 Chaoshan Development Forum invited some scholars, who have contributed doing research on Chaoshan area’s economy and society, to talk over the development in Chaoshan academically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.gd.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/ztbd/2008-11/12/content_14899002.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/xin_3011051214061071202717.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Xu Zongling is the headmaster of the Shantou University Business School.(photo from xinhuanet.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now Guangdong are trying to accelerate the development in East Guangdong, that’s a great opportunity, I think the Shantou government should do serious work to learn the provincial government’s indication,” said Zhong Jian, the office director of Chinese Economic Special Zone Research Centre at Shenzhen Universtiy. “If you miss it, you will never gain it again.” He also pointed out that the rich resource of Chaoshan Overseas Chinese, which take one third of the whole numbers of the national Overseas Chinese, should be considered as important supporting power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the years of 1996-2000, Shantou economy growed rapidly, with an average GDP growth of 12.4%. However, some local people went a wrong way to committed the crimes of evading paying taxes, smuggling, simulating and evading paying debt. Finally they are revealed around the year of 1999. This seriously effected the economy for the loss of credibility in the market. Meanwhile, the national central government strictly punished this area with a tighter watch of the local tax imposure. As a result, Shantou’s GDP went down by 2.0%, the first time in the reforming years of negative growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the statistics figures which was shown by Xu Zhongling, who is the headmaster of the Business School at Shantou University, said, in 2007 the whole GDP of the four cities of Chaoshan just took a proportion of 3.75% in Guangdong’s GDP. It can be compared with the 66.5% GDP proportion contributed by the four cities in the Pearl Delta area: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Dongguan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.gd.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/ztbd/2008-11/12/content_14899002.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/xin_0711051214063142951312.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chen Weinan, president of Chao Community General in HongKong.(photo from xinhuanet.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The intellectuals prefer to work in the Pearl Delta area but not Chaoshan area, we can see this circumstance in every year’s graduate students’ job hunting,” said, Xu. She suggested to establish a group creative supporting system to manage the creative development of Chaoshan, in order to make up the lack of intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Chaoshan was divided into three cities: Shantou, Chaozhou and Jieyang. For a long time, the three cities cooperated scarcely. This time at the forum, “collaboration” was considered important and became a key word of all the speeches. “I invited the three mayors to come to Hong Kong to deliberate the collaboration and development details,” said Chen Weinan, who is the president of Chao Community General in Hong Kong. He called the three cities as “brother cities”. He gave a speech talking about the common culture of Chaoshan and the struggling history of Chaoshan Overseas Chinese, as he had been an Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong when Hong Kong colonized by Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You speak the same dialect Chaoshan Hua, you have the same root and the same ancestor. In my eyes, as a non-Chaoshan person, you are as a whole ‘Chaoshan’,” said Wang Jun, who is the Headmaster of the senior institution of Social Science at Sun Yat-sen University. He also emphasized “collaboration” of the three cities, because he thought that the consistant planning and infrastructure of the three cities can significantly contribute to better development. Further more, he pointed out that Chaoshan should pay attention to utilize the outside resources, such as intellectuals and capital. He said the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese could offer these kind resources and could also become a bridge to develop the relationship of the outside resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.gd.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/ztbd/2008-11/12/content_14899002.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/xin_1411051214069052794214.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wang Jun, Headmaster of the senior institution of Social Science in Sun Yat-sen University emphasized(Photo from xinhuanet.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We should tear down the fence of ‘Chaoshan’,” said Lin Lunlun, who is a professor doing research on Chaoshao dialect and Chaoshan culture for many years. “Make the unitary culture into various culture.” He emphasized the “exclusion” of Chaoshan people and called a “melting” of Chaoshan culture with other parts of Guangdong culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gether various kinds of people and methods, become a melting pot for all differences,” a letter of congratulation from Li Ka Shing, who is the richest man in Asia and is a Chaoshan Overseas Chinese who contributed to construct and support Shantou University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the government is sincere to develop this area, the future development will be bright,” said Lin Shubei, who is a Chaoshan Overseas Chinese from Malaysia. He said that there are over 30 Overseas Chinese from Malaysia for this exposition. “This time we come here is mainly to establish a platform for the future inverstment and cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shantou government, as a host of this exposition, set up a serious of activities for the Chaoshan Overseas Chinese, such as a fantastic fireworks setting-off party and the Chao Opera Show. The exposition were held from Nov.10th to Nov. 12. According to Xin Hua net reports, this exposition has got about 78 billion of investment to the projects in the four cities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kids to Kids Internation - Welcome to Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/kids-to-kids-internation-welcome-to-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received an email from Amy who is from the U.S. but currently return to Shantou. Amy, I hope you won’t mind if I post your email here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This time I brought with me the hopes of many little American children. A hope to be friends with Chinese kids, particularly those living in poverty. So I brought with me school supplies, picture books and a fierce desire to find some schools willing to begin lasting relationships with schools in the US. This is more than just a little donation; it’s about kids forming relationships in this globalized world, we adults just facilitate that. This is the idea of Kids to Kids international &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ktki.org&quot;&gt;www.ktki.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally the email came on the same that I attended John Wood’s talk in my company. For those of you don’t know John Wood, you can read about him on &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1029&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Leaving-Microsoft-Change-World-Entrepreneurs/dp/006112107X&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or watch a video &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6zX2O3pQia4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I very much admire his motivate and his belief to make the world a better place through education and help to our next generation that really needs help. Although I wouldn’t consider Shantou is a city in poverty, there are still some areas that are lack of basic education. Thanks Amy for bringing the books to Shantou and also let me know about this project. I agree that it’s “more than just a little donation; it’s about kids forming relationships in this globalized world”. I left Shantou when I was 18 to see the world, and I know exactly what she meant by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my part of contribution in this blog. I will also write a post in Ezeem forum in Chinese to see if there are some local schools or charity bodies that are willing to help with this project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Only 700 beds available for 30,000 severe mental patients</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/only-700-beds-available-for-30000-severe-mental-patients.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://informationtimes.dayoo.com/html/2013-05/29/content_2264907.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/2016-03-18-下午9.38.14.png&quot; alt=&quot;A woman was killed by a mental illness patient.(photo by Lin Hong from informationtimes.dayoo.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people diagnosed with severe psychosis in Shantou has reached 30,000 , according to Shantou City Post article on October 23. Whereas, the total beds available is only 700.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social problem caused by the severe shortage is brought to the public’s attention after a severe psychosis’ attack. A man identified as Xiao and diagnosed with mental disorder, destroyed a BMW car parked on Changxia road on October 22. He used a brick and hammer to hit the car and a beauty parlor’s gate in Changxia road. He later allegedly attempted to attack the owner of the car. The police arrived on the scene before any serious harm was made and took the man to asylum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his divorce two years ago, Xiao has been behaving abnormally, said his mother with whom he lived. His neighbors complained that he often banged their doors with a hammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Li, the vice master of The Fourth People’s Hospital said, “if given timely treatment, 70 percent of the mental patients could recover. For severe patients who intend to make destructions, their behavior can also be controlled.” But for many reasons the hospitalization rate for mental patients is very low in Shantou, Doctor Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taboo toward mentally ill people is very strong. Most families see it ashamed and deny having a family member with problems at home. The lack of treatment in the hospital also makes the problem tougher.&lt;br /&gt;
The number of people with slight mental illness is more than 30,000, according to the city paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new policy, which began Saturday, is aimed at easing downtown traffic and abating noise from trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

But more importantly, being involved in such a project is beneficial to both the blog and also their journalism practices. I’m sure John will be happy to see his students continue this project after he left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou’s toy industry has begun feeling the pinch of the international economic crisis, reports said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou is the largest toy-maker in Guangdong province and workers said many of the companies are struggling to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a toy exhibition held on Oct. 9th in Shanghai, the staff at some toy manufacturing companies said a few companies were beginning to expand domestic sales to ride over the downturn in international demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong-based businessman Li Ka Shing , the main benefactor of Shantou University (STU), has promised another two billion Hong Kong dollars in grants to the institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Li made the pledge on October 15 during a meeting with Wang Yang, chief secretary of the Communist Party, Guangdong in Guangzhou. The money would be provided over a period of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1980, the billionaire philanthropist has donated nearly 4 billion Hong Kong dollars to projects in Guangdong province through a foundation named after him. STU has been the largest recipient (about 2.8 billion) of his support.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Senior Singles Turn To Marriage Agency</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/senior-singles-turn-to-marriage-agency.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior widows and widowers in China have usually never remarried. Social norms would not allow remarriage as it would be considered improper or even an embarrassment. But now the tide has changed and what was improper is no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago when he was tired from the retired life, he started a marriage agency. What he noticed during his eight years of business reflected the national statistics: senior citizens were increasingly answering the matrimonial advertisements making up 60 percent of the total. To his surprise, the total number of the group takes 60% of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Xie’s memory, senior couples usually slept in separate in China, especially in rural areas. If they lost their spouse and found another partner, they would face intense pressure from the community and family. Nowadays Xie seldom hears a voice objecting the remarriage of the seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, many seniors have no scruples about putting in a matrimonial ad with matchmakers. Sometimes their adult children advise their widowed parents to remarry. In the last few years, Xie matched about 180 couples annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes happen in young marriage seekers’ favoritisms, too, says Xie Bifeng. Most of single women wanted to marry governors, military men, and Chinese living overseas. With China’s Opening-Up Policy in 1978, women favored salespersons in state-owned companies, and later entrepreneurs. But now girls often come in and ask: Any public servants, military officers available? More and more women are taking the initiative for dating, too, Xie says.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Milk out, Soymilk in</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/milk-out-soymilk-in.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shipinanquan.baike.com/article-13378.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/19300001104356130104098522041_950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;milk with melamine     (photo from shipinanquan.com)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;                   milk with melamine     (photo from shipinanquan.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supermarket shelves around Shantou have no milk or have been replaced by soymilk and other beverages, the Shantou Evening Post said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The removal of milk from the shelves follows an order issued on October 11 by the National Commercial Department and other five departments requiring melamine tests of all milk and milk powder manufactured before September 14.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://myshantou.net/risk-life-for-salary-saved-after-3-hours.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A man bargained with his life in protest of an overdue salary by climbing up a high tension cable tower in Chenghai on Tuesday, according to Shantou Evening Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man identified only as Yao, was brought down to safety after three hours of negotiation with his previous employer. Yao accused him of not paying him a salary of 30,000 RMB, according to his wife. As a migrant worker from Jiangxi Province, Yao had worked in building construction for his previous employer three years ago in Chenghai District, Shantou City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firemen, policemen and the medics were on the scene when Yao got as close as two meters from the high tension cable. After coming down he was taken to the police station&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nan’ao Island also known as “the Chinese pioneer of wind-electricity development” has created a record of sorts in clean power generation. According to a report in the China News Service, it reached a new high in wind energy generation in the past eight months by producing 180 million kilowatt hours of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nan’ao Island is located in the south-west of the Taiwan Strait and its wind-energy generation potential is among the highest in the world. Over the years, it has become a ‘hot’ favorite for companies wanting to invest in clean-electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InfraVest GmbH from Germany is building infrastructure needed for generating 20,000 kw of electricity. A large Chinese venture, the China Guangdong Nuclear Power, has also begun preliminary work for investing in wind-electricity in Nan’ao. Upon completion of the projects in the pipeline Nan’ao will generate about 400 thousand kilowatts of clean power.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&quot;m back</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/im-back.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been two years since my last time back home. Time does fly, especially when you start working. It’s time come back to see my parents, friends and my hometown, even just for a short two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou didn’t change much since I was here in late 2006. But I must admit that I didn’t go out a lot this time, because the theme of this trip is ‘family’. I spent a lot of time with my families, sometimes even just a casual chat with couple of Kung Fu tea with parents at home can make my day. I met up with a few friends too. I’m happy to see most of them are having an enjoyable life in Shantou, somehow made me jealous! Still, if you are talking about food and living, personally opinion, Shantou is the best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started my work a year ago, I had to scarify my blogging time. You can see the last post was in May this year, which was four months ago. I do apologize the lateness of the updates here, but I’ve only got 24 hours a day and there are more important things I needed to take care of. However this blog is still important to me. If you check out the news site &lt;a href=&quot;http://News.MyShantou.net&quot;&gt;News.MyShantou.net&lt;/a&gt;, there are quite a lot of excellent articles posted by the news team from the Journalism school in Shantou University. Actually I will have a meeting with the team tomorrow to discuss the goal of next year. It’s my first meet up with the team and I’m looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the poor content of this post, but just want to say hi and let you know this blog is still in my agenda. If you are want to contribute, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you are all well. I love Shantou!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Limits Free Plastic Bags</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-limits-free-plastic-bag.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shantou has begun to ban free plastic bags commonly given out at supermarkets and shops from June 1, according to an article in the Shantou City News (SCN). Instead, consumers are encouraged to use recyclable bags, such as cloth bags, to carry their items, or to pay for plastic bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new plastic bag ban, which took effect on June 1, bans production, sale and use of ultra-thin (0.025mm) plastic bags to reduce pollution. On June 1st, some supermarkets, including Wal-Mart and Pufeng Lotus Center (a shopping center), stopped providing free plastic bags and encouraging consumers to use the circulation-used bags to take the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For consumers who still want to use plastic bags, Wal-Mart will sell to them, at 0.1 Yuan or 0.2 Yuan or 0.3 Yuan based on the size. In Lotus Center, two kinds of plastic bags were sold which cost 0.3 Yuan or 0.4 Yuan while cloth shopping bags cost 2.9 Yuan each. Different from the common packing goods, food like fresh meat and prepared food are still using ultra-thin plastic bags as in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the SCN, on the first day of the plastic bag ban, some consumers use their cloth bags bought in the shop to carry their goods, and others brought their own bags. But just several customers bought the ultra-thin plastic bags to use. “It’s really difficult to get used to the change by the plastic bag ban for us but we have to make it,” Ms Lin said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapping in Shantou Dialect</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/rap-shantou-in-dialect.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wearing loose T-shirts marked “I love ST” (ST meaning Shantou), baggy pants, hats, head scarves and fat shoes, the rappers looked slightly out of place on stage in the Great Hall of Shantou University on May 4, 2008. They looked as though they were being controlled by the music and they swung their bodies to the beat. The audience was riveted to the music and clapped along, even though they didn’t understand what the group was saying: Unique among hip-hoppers, these artists were rapping in Chaoshan dialect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/myshantou/SDF6s9QZ_AI/AAAAAAAABp0/wcDvT74QcFo/IMG_0501.JPG?imgmax=512&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stage lighting, the strong sense of rhythm and the cheers all helped the audience feel the music’s passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who ignited the passion? It’s “AFinger”the only official professional hip-hip group in Shantou. There are 12 people in “AFinger”. They are Snake, Jar, Cap, LilBiz, Co-G, Mossa, Alion, 10Stroke, POP, Megatron, Stone and Blue.S. Rap is the main style of their music and rapping in the Chaoshan dialect is their greatest feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We rap what happening in Shantou in Chaoshan hua because we want local people to be more cordial and attract more people to expand our visibility,” Snake said. “Even in China, we’re the first hip-hop group rapping in dialect.” Snake who is always wearing hip-hop style is the leader of “AFinger”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ten years ago, one girl asked me, will you wear hip-hop style forever?’” Snake said proudly. “If she watches TV, she will be surprised that I’m still sporting the hip-hop style.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snake isn’t only insisting on hip-hop style himself, but also affects a group of people to join in hip-hop style and even hip-hop music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, he opened a shop named “Lei Ju Wu” (“Lei Ju Wu” means like-minded people stay together) where he sold hip-hop clothes. Through the shop, he met many like-minded people. In 2003, he and some like-minded people set up a hip-hop group named “LAL Team”, he tried to create music and perform in small parties with group members. In 2005-12-31, the group was renamed “AFinger” and they set up a studio in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the group, there is a clear division of labor different members are responsible for creating music and lyrics, sound recording, singing, designing album covers and publicity. In 2008-2-2, the group launched their first album “Da Ji Li Shi” (meaning everything goes smoothly) in the eastern part of Guangdong. It includes 11 tracks. The lyrics all came from life, for example, “Today Sight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about a popular TV show which runs on the second channel of Shantou TV. Everyday I come home and my family is watching the program. I think many local people have the same habit. So I created the song. Many other songs are like that, for example, ‘QQ March,’ is about QQ, a common Internet chat tool used by many youths, and ‘Blue River,’ is about the popular Shantou website of the same name,” Cap, who is in charge of writing lyrics, said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the album, they are famous in the China hip-hop community. The 2007 China Hip-hop Awards invited them as guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even though we didn’t win a cup, it means the China hip-hop community pays attention to us. It’s encouraging to us,” Snake said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are minor celebrities now, but they face more pressure from work, critics and money for running the studio. Hip-hop is still fringe music in Shantou. It has a very limited audience of fans, and many people think playing hip-hop in China cannot be profitable and members are naive and idealistic. Even Cap’s parents think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cap is 21 years old. After he graduated from senior high school, he joined the AFinger team. At that time, his parents were strongly opposed and found a job for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t care what they said. I can’t do something I don’t like,” Cap said determinedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cap doesn’t live at home anymore. He lives in the studio and his band-mates pay for his day-to-day expenses.&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/myshantou/SDF8xNQZ_BI/AAAAAAAABp8/hTnMuHOXEBA/IMG_0552.JPG?imgmax=512&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the group, most members are expected to find another job to give financial support to the studio’s operation. They said their main job is playing music, while other jobs are just part-time. They have spent near 100,000 yuan on the studio. So far, they have recouped less than one third of their initial investment. This year they sold near 6000 albums worth 12yuan each, but that still isn’t enough to cover their costs. Besides the pressure above, they face the pressure from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Shantou, there are many underground bands playing hip-hop music. But they don’t organize official bands and just play informally. Now that AFinger group is gaining some local notoriety, many underground bands are making irresponsible remarks about them. They say that Afinger is commercialized and disingenuous for hip-hop music because Afinger is rapping what local people care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I admit we are commercialized and we support commercialization. In Shantou, hip-hop is fringe music. In order to get more people’s attention, we should rap about what people care about. When we’re famous enough, then we can rap about what we want to rap about, like Eminem,” Snake said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Crazy” is a song that incorporates obscenities into the lyrics.They want to show the underground scene that they aren’t just rapping about popular issues, but that they also rap about what they want. But they just put such controversial songs in Internet and will not promote them in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many people think hip-hop is indecent and ignore it. I want to guide people to recognize healthy hip-hop culture, so we will not promote songs like that in the market,” Snake said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping people recognize healthy hip-hop culture is Snake’s big wish. Besides creating new songs, the group will go to normal schools to tell students hip-hop’s history and teach them how to free-style rap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“AFinger” means they want to take a seat in China hip-hop community, but they still have their work cut out for them. However, they are working hard on it. They usually perform free to promote AFinger. Now they plan to perform for TV and record songs about the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Red Dragon Tattoo: Let Ink Meet Skin</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/red-dragon-tattoo-let-ink-meet-skin.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/scottmontreal/3703805474/in/photolist-DqQFCz-6kiGX-3KrVyF-6DhYk5-41mTVp-9KYXN4-41r4aG-bnwXUr-9L2N8m-41mVyg-4NpguK-2Jh3-7RhMJx-3Kwhh3-irUvs-vrQY6-irUx4-4Mk9vf-6nxMu-irUum-2LxwtW-41mS2z-6ZvDtC-9A5csZ-2Jia-6vXWP-bnwXsc-biptbg-4fm2PR-bnwX86-99eMMQ&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/3703805474_684f724b34_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo by scottmontreal from flickr.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the west gate of Jinmei Garden in Jinsha road, there is a parlor called “Red Dragon Tattoo Studio” four words in red lettering. Different tattoo designs lay in the shop window, artistic though simple. Separated from the waiting room with the glass door, a curtain provides some privacy for customers. It’s easy to see the equipment and tools in the studio are quite professional, and everything there seems in order. Perhaps it’s part of the reason that there’s a new type of customer these days at the parlor: young professional women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the name of the parlor “Red Dragon Tattoo Studio”, apparently their dragon stands for their Chinese cultural heritage the Chinese are said to be descended from dragons, while the color red symbolizes joy and festivity in China. It is the first and the most professional tattoo studio in Shantou at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking through the glass of shopwindow, a man wearing a black T’ang uniform and sporting short hair was tattooing a customer with the image of a small, marvelous pterosaur coming out of his left sleeve. Wearing a pair of disposable gloves, he held a professional mechanical tattoo needle on his right hand while pressing the client’s skin with his left hand, concentrating on his work. His name is WangBin, who is the tattoo artist, as well as the owner of the parlor. He also goes by the artsy moniker Red Dragon Tattoo, after his studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wang, who is over thirty-eight, is originally from Shandong province. About 17 years ago, he came to Shantou. He is one of those typical openhearted northern men with a strong personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a great passion for art, he has a love of painting which dates back to his childhood. In about 1992, he had graduated in Jinan Industrial Arts College and has improved his painting skills since then.The first time he came into contact with tattoos was the time when he was getting one for himself in 1999. Since then he has spent altogether five years studying tattoo art by himself because of interest. His drawing background makes him quickly become a good tattoo artist in Shantou. “The tattoo Red Dragon designed for me was just what I really wanted and it’s indescribable,” said Ms. Zhang, one of his clients, commenting on a butterfly she got on her bellybutton at this parlor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang opened his store in 2004. It does tattooing, covering up scars or birthmarks with tattoos and tattoo modification. Nowadays he has already earned a good reputation in the area. Many people have come for tattoos because they heard of his skills and professional attitude, and most of them are white-collar workers. As to the price, it ranges from 300 yuan to 12000 yuan, depending on the size of the tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So interesting is that it is more popular among female than male customers in Shantou. It puzzles him properly. He muses, “Maybe the aesthetic needs of women are much stronger than those of men. When women ask me to tattoo them, they love to let me tattoo the sexy parts of their bodies, such as their chests, backsides, waists and their ankles. It’s perfect!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, tattoos are not just drawing as skin is a kind of canvas which is quite different from other kinds of material. What’s more, skin could possibly dry out, and have pimples or wrinkles. That is the most challenging paper for Wang to do tattooing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 2006, he went to several well-known tattoo artists at that time, and studied their skills and techniques. Last year he took part in the 2007 China International Tattoo Arts Convention as one of the the new powers in Beijing. During the meeting, tattoo artists met with other famous tattoo artists from all over the world and all over China, such as Shanghai Tianzuntang, Beijing Stabber and Beijing Mummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more and more experiences of giving tattoos and studying there, he found that giving tattoos is not simple at all. Fortunately he has had great patience to discuss the skills with his teachers. He knew that besides the basic painting skills, they also need many skills of using needles and their own designs.”It is not just giving our customers what they want to tattoo,” said XiaoShizhe, one of his teachers who is a famous tattoo artist from Taiwan. “The natural tattoo is one which has the ideally organic unity of tattoo design and the body.” He told WangBin that it’s a great fate that they can do tattooing on the bodies of the customers.”As a tattoo artist, you must take tattooing seriously. Besides, cherish every inch of customers’ skin as if it were your own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the teachers’direction, Wang has channels his inspiration into the tattoos he designs. What’s more, he is very persistent about what he is doing. When finishing a tattoo, he always feels satisfied and comforted in the moment. However, when he sees the same one next time, he will find out lots of flaws that he hadn’t found before. Then he tries to improve it. Now, Wang is confident of his tattoo, though it’s less popular in Chaoshan areas, compared to other developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let ink meet skin!” Wang said with excitement, “The human body is the most beautiful artwork! Tattoo in any part of your body would bring you with mystery and uniqueness.” It can add a certain strange fascination to males, while it brings some sex appeal to females. He believes that the more efforts the tattoo artists make, the more popular it’ll be in Chaoshan areas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Henan Acrobats Thrive in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/henan-acrobatic-people-thrive-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gdoverseaschn.com.cn/news2010/201302/t20130217_359005.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/2016-03-25-下午3.16.03.png&quot; alt=&quot;photo from gdoverseaschn.com.cn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man was repeatedly flinging five tennis balls into the air. After launching the balls, he would catch two in his hand and keep the other three in the air doing all kinds of fancy tricks. He calls the tricks “hand skills.” 33-year old Yang Yong is one of the number of Henan acrobats who left declining interest in the art form back home to find it thriving in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have juggled for six years. At the beginning, I used three balls to practice. When I became comfortable with using three balls, I tried using four balls, then five balls. Now I want the challenge of six balls. It’s hard for me and I need more practice,” Yang Yong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acrobatic troupe of Shantou was established in 1956. It’s the only government-sponsored professional acrobatic troupe in Shantou and eastern Guangdong. In the acrobatic troupe, different people practice different skills, including “pedaling umbrellas,” which involves a person lying on a long chair kicks several umbrellas into the air, a little like juggling with their feet. They also practice “top bowl,” the art of flinging bowls into the air and catching them on their heads; “drilling barrels,” putting someone’s body into a barrel; “flying trapeze;” and, of course, contortion. Yang yong is the only one exercising hand skills in the acrobatics troupe. So often, you can see him exercise in the hall alone. He’ll not stop until he is drenched with sweat. One time, he juggled for five hours without stopping. While some of his colleagues view him as the most industrious member of the troupe, others think he is just possessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I admit I am possessed, but I think it is worth it. Being a good acrobatic actor needs great physique and skills. When you are young, physique is more important and can make you successful quickly. As you get older, skills become more important to survive in an acrobatics troupe,” Yang Yong explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acrobatics is such a hard job that many people can hardly handle it. Originally, back in Henan, there were forty people doing acrobatics with Yang Yong. At one time, that number dropped to just two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some people perform acrobatics just for the money. Only if you love acrobatics are you likely to treat it as lifelong career,” Yang Yong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang Yong originally performed acrobatics in a group in Henan. In 1998, the group was hired to join the acrobatic troupe of Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Henan, the future of acrobatic performance wasn’t bright,” Yang Yong said,”We have spent our youth on acrobatics. It’s hard for us to change our career. We should find a way to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original acrobatics troupe in Henan was privately run, meaning that they needed to perform privately contracted shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Acrobatics performances are different from other performances such as singing,” Yang Yong explained. “Some famous singers singing a song can get more than 100,000 RMB, but an acrobatics troupe performing one night can just get around 50, 000 RMB.” In order to earn more money, they performed several times each day, and even went to different places to perform each day. The teammates felt anchorless and tired. They wanted some stability in their lives. Around the same time, many old members of the Shantou acrobatics troupe left, but the local people didn’t want their children to learn acrobatics. The Shantou acrobatics troupe needed to scout talent from other areas. Their prayers were answered when the Henan acrobatics troupe performed in Shantou. The leader of the Shantou acrobatics troupe was so satisfied with their performance that he invited them to join the Shantou acrobatics troupe.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Shantou acrobatics troupe, the Henan acrobats have found a comfortable and steady home. Their lives are easier because most performances are organized by the government, and the government pays them 40% of basic wages. When they go abroad all of the logistics are taken care of by the government. Even though the government does arrange some performances for them, they still need to perform privately contracted shows as well. But it’s still an easier life than in Henan. In Henan there are nearly 2000 acrobatics troupes offering performances, while the Shantou troupe is the only troupe in all of eastern Guangdong. Their services are in much higher demand and business is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the acrobatic troupe of Shantou had gone out of its predicaments having no actors and there are twenty-five locals and twenty Henan people now. 10 of 45 people are students. They come from Henan, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily exercises run from 9am to 12pm and from 3pm to 6pm. Before practicing specific performance skills, the students warm up with handstands. When newcomers join the troupe, handstands are a difficult undertaking and require the help of a partner. But with a lot of practice, they quickly become a basic part of their repertoire. From there they learn the other basics, like turning a somersault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou people don’t want their children to exercise acrobatics because it’s hard. But acrobatics for the Henan children is more than a job. It’s also like a game, especially when there are no adults around. A girl was using two strings hung on the ceiling to play flying trapeze and practice handstands. Another girl was riding a giraffe unicycle [this is a type of tall unicycle] to meet her teammate in the air. A little boy was walking on a thin rope crazily. Another boy was teasing him on the floor.Generally speaking, they treat the hall as an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lily Zhao, 13years old, pulling her hair back and wearing sportswear. When called on, she smiled. Because of her great talent as a contortionist, she has traveled to many foreign countries to perform with the acrobatic troupe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the troupe has traveled to many places-including Africa, Japan, Malaysia, France, the United States, Holland and Hong Kong-for cultural exchanges, to console disaster victims, and take part in celebrations put on by the Ministry of Culture. In January of 2008, the acrobatic troupe of Shantou went to France on one such cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year, we went to France to perform.When we appeared on the stage, the audiences called ‘Lily Zhao’ loudly. Many audiences like Lily’s performance,” Xiao Mei, Lily’s teacher, said .”She is a talented child. You don’t need to tell her the tips of ‘contortion,’ because her body is naturally soft enough. Before performing acrobatics, many contortionists need to warm-up for at least 30 minutes. But Lily doesn’t need to; she can do it anytime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Lily has more opportunities than other children and gets a lot of attention, she is still a child. She’s not sure why she learns acrobatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I was 6 years old, my mother asked me to follow my relatives and join the acrobatic troupe of Shantou. I neither love nor hate acrobatics. But I’ll feel unhappy if I can’t do my training well,” she said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she has an old sister and a young brother in her hometown. “Sometimes I miss them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the 10 students were introduced to the troupe by their relatives. They can go home every two years. They miss their families, too. But they must control their emotion and can’t delay exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are well-behaved.” XiaoMei said approvingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao Mei is the children’s teacher and is the only person exercising “pedaling umbrella.” “Pedaling umbrella” is a traditional acrobatics program, but not many people want to exercise it because it’s troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In order to attract audiences, you couldn’t just exercise ‘pedaling umbrella’. You need to pedal other objects like tables. But taking a table to perform is troublesome,” Xiao Mei said with a forced smile. “Actually pedaling table is easier than pedaling umbrella. An umbrella is so light. It is hard to focus and make it stable. It can only be performed when the air is completely still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am trying to find Suitable candidates to exercise it. It’s an acrobatic tradition and we can’t lose it,” XiaoMei said assuredly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acrobatics has a long history in China. It needs not only heirs but also development and innovation. The children, XiaoMei and YangYong are taking it forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Gives a Hand to Sichuan Again</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-gives-a-hand-to-sichuan-again.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_53ee86ff0100wm5a.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/53ee86fftb3547a6c721c690.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;photo from blog.sina.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six days after the deadly earthquake in Sichuan, rescue workers were both finding survivors and recovering bodies. According to the Emergency Office of the State Council, as of 2 PM on May 18th, the official death toll from the calamity was 32,477. Along with many cities in China, Shantou reached out to Sichuan, donating money and necessities for emergency aid to the Sichuan people. Some Shantou residents even drove to Sichuan with food on their own and provided assistance directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 18, a big charity performance, named “We are families”, was held on the Lin Baixin Square in Shantou. The show, which lasted from 8 PM to 10 PM, was organized by the Shantou Charity Federation and Shantou Cunxinshantang Welfare Community with the aim of collecting more donations to support Sichuan earthquake area. Dancing, singing and recitations were shown to audiences by volunteers from the Shantou Broadcasting Station and several schools. Many people showed up to donate and left soon without watching the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the performance, audiences were asked to mourn the casualties in Sichuan earthquake for three minutes. Although it was raining, everyone stood solemnly in silent tribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Chen, 43, a volunteer of the welfare community, stood beside the collection box with other volunteers, helping to collect donation money. When people put money into the box, Chen and others would place a sticker of Cunxinshantang Welfare Community on them and thank them for their kindness. “I bursted into tears when I saw so many dead children on TV,” Chen said. Chen was astonished by the tragic disaster and she attended several fundraisers for Sichuan in the past few days. Chen herself donated 300 Yuan to aid in the next day after the earthquake attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the whole collection activity, people of all ages, children, students, adults and the elderly, came to donate incessantly. Shu Ming, a student from Shantou Jingshan High School, contributed 10 Yuan in the donation. “Although it’s not so much,” Shu said, “I hope I can help someone there.” Shu mentioned that many of his classmates donated money after they heard the news and that they all hoped the students suffering from the earthquake can continue their studies soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A middle-age man, after stuffing 1000 Yuan into the collection box, walked away quickly. When asked his name, he shook his hand and said, “I just came to help–no need to be known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the performance, two collection boxes were taken to the stage by volunteers. According to them, the two boxes, which were used to accumulate notes and coins, once belonged to two children. But after they heard about the earthquake in Sichuan, the owners donated both the boxes and money inside to help.After donating, the children left. One volunteer said she was so moved by the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the organizers, Shantou Cunxinshantang Welfare Community donated 300,000 Yuan to the disaster area the night. According to the community, it was their second donation for Sichuan. “Seeing our compatriots suffering from anguish, we are also very distressed,” said Yang Guangxiong, the president of Shantou Charity Federation. “The disaster is heartless but we aren’t,” Yang said, “We hope more people would help them to get through these difficulties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-hour long performance attracted up to 200 citizens who came to watch and donate money. Around 100 volunteers held the performance and raised funds together. According to the welfare community website, the donation amount will be released to the public and the money will sent to Sichuan soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Entertainment Establishments Suspended Their Business for Three Days in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/entertainment-places-paused-on-their-businesses-for-three-days-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shantou’s cultural service and law enforcement agency enforced the notice that all entertainment establishments were directed to pause their operation because of the national lamentation period. They received a pressing notice from Guangdong province’s ministry of culture. All entertainment establishments were directed to suspend their operation for three days, from May 19th to May 21st, according to Shantou Daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou culture and news broadcasting and publishing office put the pressing notice into effect on the night of the 18th as soon as they received it. The officers began to go on an inspection tour of the city in order to make sure that the main singing and dance grounds and entertainment places had stopped their businesses. During the national lamentation period, all the performance groups and internet bars were forbidden to have any kind of entertainment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>24 Shantou Tourists in Sichuan During Quake, None Thought to be Dead</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/24-shantou-tourists-stayed-in-sichuan-no-quake-deaths-of-shantou-for-the-moment.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 12th at 14:28, a devastating magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck in Wenchuan county, an Abei Zang and Qiang national minority autonomous region in Sichuan province, wreaking destruction over much of Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces and Chongqing, according to Shantou Daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that as of 8:20 AM on May 13th, about 2000 tourists were visiting this autonomous region. On May 13th, 24 Shantou tourists in Chengdu and Leshan of Sichuan province were stranded. At present, there is no indication that any of the Shantou tourists were hurt, according to Shantou Tourism Bureau. Chenbin, the deputy director general of Shantou Tourism Bureau said that they had tried to know more information about the stranded Shantou tourists from all the travel agencies. In addition, all travel agencies were asked to stop booking trips to the areas affected by the earthquake. It is reported that guides had taken the stranded Shantou tourists to safe places, and made every effort to let them go back to Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobbers Flash Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/mobbers-flash-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day in March 2008, Lee, around 25, shopped with his friend in Jin Xin Road in downtown Shantou. The street also called Walking Street was crowded with young people every where buying clothes as usual. Almost in the same second, some boys and girls around Lee stop moving: two boys and two girls were playing gobang on the floor, one young man were sending sms when walking, two guys were playing flyingcup game on the table in the middle of the street for 5 minutes, up to 20 young people in the street were keeping still, even though they were in the middle of walking, drinking or tying shoelaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/myshantou/SCEU1nKxLLI/AAAAAAAAA_I/He7df35FUZs/s800/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is bizarre,” Lee said with a bewilder look. Before he figured out what happened, the weird group quickly moved on and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the only time that in Shantou a bunch of young people, most of them are students, surprised passers-by in a public place like street and shopping mall. This movement is famous in the occident, which named flash mob: jokers gather en masse using internet technology, perform a scheduled act and then disperse quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first flash mob movement organized in Manhattan, US, 2003, by Bill Wasik, when about 50 participators flooded into a hotel and applauded together for 15 seconds, the act crazily spread cross American and Europe. Later in the next year, 2004, the first Chinese mobbers appeared in Beijing. From then on, Flash mob began popular among Chinese youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different forms of flash mob, such as pillow fight flash mob, zombie walk flash mob, synchronized applause or keeping still, birdcall and so on. Most of the mobbers are not care about the forms but the fact that they attracted people. Why much young men are crazy for this game? The staff in Moral Education Office of Shantou Education Bureau, Ms Chen, gave an answer: the new generation are yearn for showing themselves to others and getting attention. She said that some young people now are facing huge pressures and want to find a way to release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first flash mob incident of Shantou occurred in September 2004, when the internet gained ground in the city. When night fell in the People Square in downtown, a group of boys ran quickly from far and near to the fountain in the east of the square and took off their shoes, marching in a circle around the fountain. After several minutes, the boys put on their shoes and dropped off in a second. The sudden action surprised citizens strolling in the square very much. There was hardly nobody knew what’s the action, according to Ding Shuo, a journalist in Shantou. “The flash mob in Shantou in a sense is following the world trend closely,” Ding said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He mentioned that several students lay on the floor and pretended to dead in Jing Xing Road years ago, 2004, caused a tumult in the street and the pass-by even called the police for help. “We have right of assemblage,” Ding said. But he pointed out that they need to improve by making the flash mob meaningful but not harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/myshantou/SCEU1nKxLMI/AAAAAAAAA_Q/LW8680CM0z4/s800/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 29, 2008, Ding Shuo organized a flash mob action in Fragrant Park, an old building in old part of Shantou facing torn down problem. Ding and other mobbers lined in a big letter “NO” to protect the building. Ding said that they hoped more citizens could pay more attention of the old building in Shatou through the flash mob movement. In the ten minutes action, an old woman in the neighborhood came out and shouted to the mobbers “mad”, and other neighborhood seemed no interest in their action.But the mobbers believed they are right. “It do have the reaction although the way is special,” Jimi, a mobbers in the action working in website company said. Ms Hu, a young girl in the group said she hoped the flash mob can persuaded more Shantouese protecting their culture patrimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside, Ding Shuo with his friend SK, a 18 years old high school student in Shantou, organized a “follow walk flash mob” on 16th, this April. As other flash mob, the action collected people and announced the mainly instruction on Shantou’s several electronic forums in internet, like Ezeem.com and Blue Riverside BBS, QQ chatting room (a way of online chat) and email. Before the movement, around forty young people gathered in the park of Wal-Mart store and the organized instructed the detail plan. Later soon, they stood in a long queue and walked following their chose target, tow girls shopping. At the first minutes, the girls didn’t notice the crowd behind them, but soon they were scared by the mobbing and ran away with laughter. Subsequently, the mobbers went to find a new target. The flash mobbing is bizarre in most citizens’ eye, but SK defecated that it’s just for fun and harmless.&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/myshantou/SCEU1nKxLKI/AAAAAAAAA_A/eWeQkwmdJi8/s400/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the “keeping still game” in March, flash mob are usually predetermined. However, the organizer would not release the detailed plan, such as the exactly time, location and secret signal to begin unless the last minute. The flash mobbers don’t want the plan tipped off and failed, according to the young mobber SK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen Ning, a guy who is one of the “fastest hands man” of play flyingcup match in the Shantou, held three times flyingcup flash mob. Flyingcup is a game to compete the rapidity of piling up paper cups to certain shapes, and the faster the better. This February, Chen with his fellows performed a sudden flyingcup match in McDonald restaurant. In the busy McDonald, when everybody was eating, Chen Ning wearing a red T-shirt came to the counter, got a straw and held over the head as a secret beginning signal. Simultaneously, strong sound like rainstorm filled with every where in the restaurant. It was the mobbers playing flyingcup game and the big sound was made by the cups piling. In a given short time, the group ran out of the hall leaving people with puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was my first time to join the flash mob,” Tang, a 16 years old mobber, said, “I was so intense but excited.” Most of the flash mob participants said that they are excited to see the viewers’ open-eyes with surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, the flash mobbers know what they do may not be understood and accepted by most people in Shantou, they would like to plan and carry out more action. Recently, new flash mob notice is posted in the QQ chatting room space. Although the details are not release, many mobbers of the group are ready to flash in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low Possibility of Earthquake in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/low-possibility-of-earthquake-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two days after the 7.8 magnitude “5.12” earthquake that struck Wenchuan, Sichuan Province, the Shantou City Post reports that there is a low possibility of such an earthquake in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the source cited in the paper from the Shantou Seismological Bureau, the possibility of a high-intensity earthquake in Shantou is low in the near future because of the lack of seismic activity in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bureau chief Shi Lewen said some residents called in and said they felt a slight tremor in high buildings during the Sichuan earthquakes. He explained that this was a high-magnitude earthquake, with a huge amount of energy released far and wide, causing skyscrapers to shake. However, Shantou and Wenchuan are in different seismic belts with distinct geographic structures, and therefore there is no obvious connection between seismic activities in the two regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou is located in the Southeastern Coastal Seismic Belt in China, the main location of seismic activities in Guangdong Province. Since 1970, earthquakes have mainly been small, at most measuring 4 in magnitude. Based on study and observations, there are no signs that Shantou would have large- or medium-size quakes in near future, said the chief Shi Lewen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Responds to Sichuan Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-responds-to-sichuan-earthquake.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday night, three days after the “5.12” Sichuan earthquake, Shantou University students gathered and offered prayers for mourning for the people killed in the “5.12” Sichuan earthquake .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 50 to 60 students and teachers, half of whom were Sichuanese, held candles and sang after 9 pm on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university and the foundation that supports it are engaged in a variety of commemoration and donation activities in response to the worst earthquake in China in thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Thursday night ceremony, emotions ranged from a feeling of trying to boost damaged spirts to pure grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sichuan, come on! Sichuan, come on!” Shi Yangen, a sophomore student from Sichuan, one of the organizers, yelled out, keeping his fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Though we cannot go back to our hometown to relieve the people in disaster, we can send them our best wishes, “he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all the people stood in silent tribute for about three minutes. People wept as candles were lit and the songs began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Mengmeng, one of Sichuan students, was weeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I finally dialed the number successfully, when I heard my mom speak, I was more than glad to say nothing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that her parents were fortunate to escape, though the buildings they lived in were cracked during the quake. “Sichuan, come on! All the things will go well!”she called out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, those gathered at the ceremony sang songs including “Tomorrow Will Be Better” and “Mother Is The Best in This World,”  some of the most conventional songs Chinese sing to the victims of the “5.12” Sichuan earthquake, including those who became parentless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different ways of contributing by students and faculties have been undertaken on the campus since the “5.12”disaster occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Li Ka Shing Foundation, the biggest sponsor of Shantou University, announced a contribution of RMB 30 million from its “Just In Time Fund” to the Minstry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Education for assisting in the rebuilding in Sichuan, according to the university website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days after the earthquake, a donation activity was organized by the Sichuan Students Union, with other students’ voluntary associations pitching in to help. Students passed by and without hesitation dropped cash into the boxes that had been set out. The organizers declared that the donations would be sent to the Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBS Forum, the university’s online discussion forum, has been filled with posts of news on the quake, sadness and encouragement, and opinions on how students can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/myshantou/MournSichuan2/photo#5201122360116771138&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/myshantou/SC4ZOtQZ-UI/AAAAAAAABZw/AGT08kc2dVI/s800/%EF%BC%A3%EF%BD%88%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%92%EF%BD%89%EF%BD%94%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%82%EF%BD%8C%E3%80%80%EF%BD%93%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%8C%EF%BD%8C%EF%BD%89%EF%BD%8E%EF%BD%87.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girls from Room 101 in F dorm-building had their way to help. On 15th, three days after the disaster, they started a charity sale of second-hand items in the lounge of the dorm-building, to raise funds for Sichuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello, we are doing charity. The money is for the quake-stricken area,” said Liu Zhuhuan to anyone who dropped by. She donated her guitar and it was sold for 40 yuan. Donating clothes is costly in terms of disinfection and transportation, so money is most directly helpful, said Liu Wenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides on campus activities,all circles in downtown are also active in the work of donation.There are five major charities in Shantou, the most active of which is Cunxin charity. The charity has assisted in several major events such as the flood in 1998, the snow storms of January 2008 and now the Sichuan earthquake. On the day right after the earthquake happened, the charity launched a collection for Sichuan victims in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city wide donation will last for a week.People who passed by the downtown collection sites responded actively. Most of the donors contributed more than 100 RMB. The money that had been collected would be sent to the head charity organization, then transferred to the disaster area, members of the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Apple Chan and Joanne Lau also contributed. Liu Jinhua contributed to the photos.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://myshantou.net/we-are-waiting-for-the-olympic-torch.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The coming of the Olympic torch was an event that caused a lot of excitement for Shantou and its people.On May 10 the torch relay made its way to Shantou. The last stopover among four cities in Guangdong province, Shantou started her flame-lighting ceremony in a strong rain at 8 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Olympic torch relay in Shantou took 10 hours to make the 48-kilometer journey. The torches were carried by 208 torchbearers most of whom were born in Shantou and have made great contributions to either local or national athletics. The runners included a weightlifting coach and champion, six world diving champions and other outstanding citizens from Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both streets that the torches were expected to pass by or streets nearby the route were crowded with people turning out for the Olympic torch. Some of them were from Chaozhou, a city next to Shantou, as well as representatives of other towns around Shantou. Some of them arrived at their spots along the route in the early morning. Although it rained most of the time during the torch relay, a man exclaimed , “The rain can not extinguish our passion!”after the torch passed the Lin Baixin Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people still stayed to cheer the Olympic an hour after the relay in the Square Road next to Lin Baixin Square. They shouted loudly, “Come on China, Come on Shantou” and then sang the national anthem together over and over again as some beat gongs and drums.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Felt Slight Shock after Sichuan Consuming Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-felt-slight-shock-after-sichuans-consuming-earthquake.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to an article from the website of Shantou News, some Shantou citizens in high-rises were alarmed by a swaying sensation after Sichuan’s consuming earthquake on the afternoon of May 12th. Shi Yong Wen, Director General of Shantou Seismological Bureau, said in an interview that quite a few citizens called to ask if there had been a earthquake during 2:30pm to 3:00pm on May 12th, right after the mighty earthquake took place in Sichuan Province. “I found myself swaying and felt not quite well,” said Miss Lin, an office worker at a 29-store building in Jin Sha East Road, downtown Shantou. “It occurred to me immediately that we might be having an earthquake after I saw all the workers in the office were swaying.” Although Shantou felt slight shock related to the Sichuan earthquake, no damage was done to the city, according to the Shantou Seismological Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got some photos from my parents. These were taken in Changping Road on the 20th April. Shantou was flooded within a few hours after a heavy rain. My dad complained about the drainage system and said it needs to be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/QQ截图20131104195740-720x340.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;QQ截图20131104195740-720x340&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summer is almost here, Shantou is going to enter a typhoon season. But scene like this is still rare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Motorcycle Purse Snatching Under Investigation</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/motorcycle-purse-snatching-under-investigation.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the evening of April 19th, two muggers on a motorcycle robbed a female pedestrian in Danxia Zhuang of Longhu area, according to an article in the Shantou Daily. The victim was towed for hundreds of meters by the robbers’ motorcycle and was badly injured. The public security bureau is investigating the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 9:00 p.m. of that day in Danxia Zhuang, the two robbers driving a motorcycle knocked the woman down and robbed her of her purse. During an intense struggle, the woman’s hair was suddenly wrapped into the trailing wheel of the motorcycle. However, the muggers quickly fled in disorder by motorcycle, irrespective of the consequence. Then the woman was towed for hundreds of meter by the robbers’ motorcycle and was badly injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days the police are offering a reward of 50 thousand yuan for information about the robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests that motorcycle purse snatching is a common occurrence in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three Crashes and Three Deaths in a Night</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/three-crashes-and-three-deaths-in-a-night.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Special Zone Evening Post reported three traffic accidents on the highway from Shenzhen to Shantou within the same night. Three people including two drivers died in the accidents, and eight people were injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first crash happened on the Haiwan Bridge in Shantou at about 7 pm on April 25 when it was raining. A truck crashed into the back of a large bus which was heading for Fujian, tearing a big hole in the back of the bus. Seven passengers were injured, two of whom had bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crash resulted in traffic jams on the highway and two more collisions afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truck en route to Shantou crashed into a larger truck at 10 pm, 500 meters away from the spot of the first crash. The driver of the large truck said a big sound of the collision erupted, when he was slowing down for the traffic jam. The driver of the smaller truck was killed at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two hours later another rear-end collision between two trucks took place 300 meters away from the second accident. One of the drivers died and the other was badly injured.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Demonstrators Call Out for their Iron Rice Bowl Back</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/workers-protest-at-shantou-power-bureau.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every day from Monday to Friday, 17 middle-aged workers sit in front of the building of Shantou Power Bureau near Jinsha park in Jinping district, one of the most prosperous places in Shantou. A banner they have hung between two trees says “Maintain Legal Rights” and “Give Our Jobs Back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As protests go, it’s low key: The demonstrators usually sit in a circle on their own chairs, making tea with their own hot water and tea leaves. On the rainy days, they move to the Jingfeng Building for a shelter nearby. During the weekend and pouring wet days, they are off. The demonstration has gone on for four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rare to see long-lasting public demonstrations in Shantou, but the target of this one is a common China story: the privatization of state owned companies, and the end of a system that provided workers life-long employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstrators are workers of the Tuopu Power Plant, a company that used to belong to the Shantou Power Bureau, a state-owned utility. The Tuopu Power Plant was privatized in 1994. Now it has stopped producing power and is facing bankruptcy. Its workers have been told to find new jobs. Along the way someone forgot to tell the employees they were working for a private company, the protestors say. They have a constant refrain: We were supposed to be life-long workers of a state-owned company, and we want our iron rice bowl back. They are demonstrating to convince the utility company to give their jobs back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workers say their job status was illegally changed when the Tuopu plant was privatized in 1994. But according to insiders in the state-owned company, the workers were informed that they had become private company employees in 1994. The workers, however, deny knowing about their change in status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the privatization of the plant, about 100 young workers from the Shantou Power Bureau, including the 17 demonstrators, were sent to the Tuopu plant to work from 1990 to late 1993. They installed nearly 30 sets of diesel generators, which helped to build up Tuopu Power Plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by 2006, the Tuopu plant was facing the rising oil prices and bankruptcy. They were also facing a government regulation that all diesel generator powered factories must be shut by 2010. Now the company is selling off the diesel generators so that the workers can be paid. But still the workers face unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was strange,” said one of the demonstrators, Huang Weitao, “We were supposed to be life-long workers.” He said that since the Shantou Power Bureau, their employer in their eyes, is not going bankrupt, they shouldn’t lose their iron rice bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, before the Labor System Reformation in 1986, some of those who work for state-owned company had an “iron rice bowl” and never worried about unemployment. Since the workers joined the Bureau before 1986, they believed they were part of this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in late 2006 the manager Fang Jianwu informed them that the Tuopu plant would close and they would have to find new jobs. Huang Weitao and other workers negotiated with the private company from then on, but they failed to reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling the story, Huang, the de facto leader of the group, was most talkative among the demonstrators. Twice while talking to reporters, security guards from the Bureau came out to harass the group. At one point, Huang and his workmates burst into anger and quarreled with the guard in local dialect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 17, Huang Weitao passed the entrance test and became a proud “life-long” worker in Shantou Power Bureau. When he was sent to Tuopu Plant, he was 27, at an age he described himself as energetic and enthusiastic. “It is my unfortunate destiny to contribute my youth to the company,”he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Huang and other protestors are unfortunate or not, they have to live with their decisions, according to Du Xiaodan, a representative of the worker’s union in the Shantou Power Bureau. “It is a matter of choice,” Du said, comparing the workers’ decisions to high school students choosing their university before the College Entrance Examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They all knew,” Du said. He also said that some staff in the public utility company were even willing to move to the privatized Tuopu company for higher salaries and benefits. Du pointed out that the workers had signed the contracts with Tuopu plant and  knew their employer had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They have signed three contracts in all,” said Du Xiaodan in the Bureau. He explained that according to the Chinese Labor Law, after workers signed another contract, the first contract will be put an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the strikers insist that the contracts are fake and illegal. “If 100 Yuan cash is fake, it is not really 100 Yuan,” said Huang Weitao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ma Shenghui, another worker among the demonstrators, is the group’s expert on contracts. He said that a valid contract should be ratified by the Shantou Labor Bureau, the official department in charge of employer-employee relationships in Shantou.They were sure that the contracts were not ratified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They never want to talk with us face to face in a reasonable way,” Ma said, pointing to the Bureau building. “They just do something secretly behind us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/imgn5f0146.1_ed1_page09_45808149.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;imgn5f0146.1_ed1_page09_45808149&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked why they did not sue the Bureau, since they are so determined, Huang said that the public utility was a “superpower” in the city and would simply ignore the ruling. He also smiled and said that they didn’t have money to afford a lawsuit. No lawyer would be willing to take it, either, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists of News.Myshantou.net took the copies of three contracts of the disputed contracts and consulted the Shantou Legal Aid Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the contracts signed with Tuopu Power Plant were valid, which means the labor relationship with the state-owned company had lost its validity, said Lu Ying, a consultant in the Legal Aid Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter whether the contracts have been ratified or not by the Labor Bureau,it does come into force, as long as both sides come to an agreement and sign it,” said Lu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 11 this year, the 17 of the workers protested carrying banners near the building gate. Guards stopped them. They were not real riot police, but in uniform and temporarily employed by the Bureau, the demonstrators said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were frightened to death!” Huang Weitao, said jokingly, referring to a lack of bravery among the demonstrators. “Then we could only sit here quietly.”Others in the group laughed at Huang’s self-deprecating humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ma Shenghui, another demonstrator, said in a heavy tone. “We have come through all sorts of oppression and we have overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There used to be 88 protesting workers. Now, only the 17 are still holding on. “Those who have given up lose their right to defend their rights,”said Huang Weitao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huang has a sense that middle-aged men like him are supposed to be pillars of the family, with the responsibility of raising children and attending to the elderly. But he believes in the value of demonstrating. “We are not killing the time,”he said. “We are persisting for our future life and for the sake of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mangu: Base of the Shantou Cosplayers</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/mangu-base-of-the-shantou-cosplayers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three young guys were walking down to center of the room. They all dressed in black costumes like ancient Japanese warriors. One of them had really long hair and held a long sword. The one with red hair held a giant sinker. The other with white hair had a giant gargoyle hand. They were brandishing their own “weapons” while posing. Then they began to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But their fighting is more a form of fun than any real conflict. They are called “Cosplayers.” On the Christmas Day of last year, a cartoon book store named “Mangu” was stuffed with cosplayers and their fans. Packs of youngsters were holding a party there. It is a frequent gathering place for fans of comics and cosplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are the first cartoon book store in Shantou that publicly support cosplay activities,” said Wang Yang, the owner of the book store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosplay is a short term for “Costume Play.” Cosplay is something like role play, but not actually the same. Many people thought cosplay comes from Japan. Japan is the creator of the nowadays’ cosplay style, but the root of cosplay is America. In 1955 Walt Disney established the first Disney Land in the world. Disney had performers dress like Mickey and other well-known cartoon characters in order to attract visitors. This is the original form of cosplay and Mickey in a sense is the primogenitor of today’s cosplayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosplay reached mainland China very late, compared to Hongkong and Taiwan. In 2000 the mainland successfully held the first cosplay contest. However, according to Wang, the comic bookstore owner, cosplay is not widespread and is only popular in a few coastal cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou is not one of those open cities; it lags behind Guangzhou and Shenzhen in opportunities and places for entertainment. However, there are certain cosplay leagues in Shantou such as Ling Wu She, Zhi Yin She, Can Yue She, Fei She. Cosplay fans often join a favourite league so that they can actually pick one favourite character to cos, which means perform in the character’s costume themselves and act like the character. Only by joining a league can they take part in cosplay contests and participate in activities. Ling Wu She is one of the most sweeping leagues in Shantou, according to its founder. Most of the leagues are spontaneous youthful organizations that were established by cosplay fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang, the comic bookstore owner, is also a big fans of cosplay, although he knows cosplay is not so popular in the region where he lives. “Many people think cosplayers are freaks and sniff at them, especially parents, but I really don’t think they understand the culture of cosplay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cosplayers, Liku, has pursued his passion for two years. Once Liku’s father suddenly broke into her room and tore up her costume up when she was making it. Another cosplayer Dan Qi said that sometimes they were called un-patriotic when wearing Japanese costumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang pointed out the reason why parents don’t think cosplay brings any benefit to their children. As far as he knows, some students indeed don’t do well in their studies after they have pursued cosplay, but it doesn’t mean they don’t want to study. By taking part in cosplay activities, they can absorb another kind of culture outside school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the development of cosplay in Shantou, Wang made up his mind to establish a place for cosplay and catoon fans to gather, hold meetings and parties. “By then I can take part in the cosplay activities as well,” said Wang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosplay contestants usually make costumes together and hold meetings in Mangu before a competition. Soon after Mangu had been constructed, it became a base of the cosplay unions. Wang says he’s offering more than just materials for sale; he’s offering a community and home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t just sell cartoon books. I also offer foods so it’s more like a book bar for people to relax. My customers love to come by after school or during the weekend, reading cartoon books and sharing news with one another,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lin and Her Chaoshan Opera Orchestra</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/lin-and-her-chaoshan-opera-orchestra.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like lightning in the quiet sky,a sharp bamboo flute sounded. Lin Miaoqing raised the black microphone in her right hand, straightened her back and stared at the music sheet on the rusty iron stand. Hearing the music, she smiled and began to sing Chaoshan opera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin wore a red coat with some big flowers on it. She had pink rouge on her face and red lipstick on her mouth. A gold necklace on her neck was shining under the sunshine.A black mobile phone and a pair of fashion sunglasses were hung in front of her chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin is almost sixty-seven years old but she loves fashion as much as the young people. And her biggest hobby is to sing Chaoshan songs. She began her love affair with Chaoshan opera when she was a nine-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin runs a group for elderly people that practice traditional folk arts in Shantou City.The musical group for which Lin sings gathers daily and plays the Chaoshan drum,cymbal,and erhu, a kind of Chinese lute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A microphone and music stand complete the set up.The orchestra plays Chaoshan music on the middle of the Haibin Road,opposite to the People Square of Shantou, a road that runs along Shantou bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a group of regulars are often present, the get together is open to anyone. Most are from a crowd of retired people who are interested in Chaoshan music, and most of them began to learn how to play the instruments after they retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaoshan opera is a kind of opera that combines Chaozhou music and the other kinds of Chaoshan folk art. It is similar in style and sound to Beijing opera, immortalized in such films as “Farewell My Concubine.” This local opera has its roots in the Ming Dynasty and is sung in Chaozhou dialect. Chaoshan opera is mainly found in eastern Guangdong, southern Fujian, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin said there was about forty people in her group now,because of Chaoshan music they came together and enjoy the fun that music brought to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin used to be a teacher. After she retired, she became active in the group for the elderly. Lin’s children have grown up so she has a lot of time to spend in this group. She comes to Haibin Road at seven o’clock almost every morning(except the very bad weather and Spring Festival),then hires two people to deliver the group’s instruments and some chairs to the middle of Haibin Road from a fixed place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group’s singing always attracts the passers to stop and listen,no matter they are young or old.They have become a beautiful scenic of Haibin Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Drink tea,drink tea,please,”Lin enthusiastically invited the people who listened to their songs to have Kung Fu Tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am eighty years old now. I enjoy drinking tea and playing instruments here,we are like a big family,”Zheng Qiu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin said they are a legitimate group which was allowed by the government. They have to spend one thousand RMB a month on the group’s electricity,gas,food, rent instruments. “We just get the funding from the kind-hearted peole’s donation,but most of the time,I need to bring some money to make up the difference,”Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the audience were taking in both the music and the scenery, as the spot Lin and her group perform is a stone’s throw from the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t sing the Chanzhou opera,but I like to stay here to listen them and feel the wind,it is comfortable, “ said Lin He, a passerby who had stopped to watch the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sea wind blew in turning sheets of music. Lin set down the microphone, took a clamp from her handbag,and clipped the music sheet to the iron stand.As the music started again, she began to sing the next song.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Pinching and Scraping Life</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/a-pinching-and-scraping-life.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Located on a hill near Shantou Seismological Bureau, near Shantou University, there is a dilapidated shanty standing amid a rubbish dump. A dog is barking outside the shanty, seemingly at his master. An old man with gray hair stoops with difficulty to pick up the wine bottles which are thrown away by others. When he finishes separating the rubbish into different categories, he lights up a cigarette and puffs deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His name is Zhou Zhanlian. He has been living here alone for more than sixteen years. He has no spouse and is over seventy. The barking dog is his only partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhou Zhanlian is just one of the migrant workers living in Shantou. He comes from a poor countryside town called Fengyang in Anhui province. With a low education level, he lives by manual labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I left my hometown and came here to look for fortune. However, illiteracy is my serious handicap in my life,” Zhou frowned and said, forcing a smile. It has been more than seventeen years since he came here. In 1991, it cost him twenty yuan to get from Anhui to Shantou. At that time, with the reform and opening up of China, Shantou was taking advantage of being an SEZ and its economy had grown tremendously. So Zhou made up his mind to go to Shantou to carve out a career for himself, though he was almost fifty years old then. However, things proved difficult for a worker from outside Guangdong province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is because you are migrant worker who comes from another province. The residents of Shantou city always look down on migrant workers, especially one who has a low education level,” Zhou said, puffing angrily on his cigarette. Flies flirted about him in the twilight, adding to his annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of migrant farm workers in Guangdong is estimated at 26.2 million, according to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Labor and Social Security. And only in Shantou the number is up to about 800 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “floating population” phenomenon has become a problem in many coastal areas of China. Migrant laborers have no permanent residence permit; they have the unequal status under the resident registration system, which has the function to protect local residents’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with his fellow provincials, who live in Tuopu area, it was not easy for Zhou to find a regular job, but possible to get some odd ones at that time. He was a cleaner in Shantou Seismological Bureau and earned fifty yuan per month when he came here at the beginning. Later his salary went up to 150 yuan per month. Although it was a low income, he still kept optimistic and made every effort to clean the seismological bureau. However, after five years, he said, he was fired because of his old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know why they fired me at that time. The predecessor of the director in Shantou Seismological Bureau just told me that I was too old to do this job. Then I had to leave. I have inability to read, so when I lost my job, I didn’t know what to do. I just went to do some odd-jobs, like picking up the rubbish to sell in order to support myself,” Zhou said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About five years ago, Zhou gleaned some odd bits of wood to build his shanty in the hill. At that time many people who live nearby was disgusted with Zhou because he created the odoriferous rubbish dump. But people nearby changed their view of him after they got to know him better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Things have been changed because of Zhou’s good moral quality– he is kindhearted,” said by one of Zhou’s neighbors, Mr. Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zhou is still a scavenger, who goes to glean and collect scrap. Every day at 2 A.M. , he must get up to gather the rubbish in the Tuopu area. “Why do I wake up so early? It’s just because there would be much more household garbage when almost all the shops and stores have been closed the doors at that time. Everyone who does this job often competes to gather the rubbish as early as possible,” Zhou said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He earns about ten yuan a day, which he says is enough. The desirable rubbish that he collects are the used paper products and wine bottles. The used paper products is 0.5 to 0.6 yuan per half a kilogramme, while the bottles are 0.3 to 0.5 yuan per half a kilogramme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ke Wanni, who sells rechargeable phone cards, lives at No.303, the eleventh building of Shantou Seismological Bureau. She is one of Zhou’s neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Zhou is really a hardworking and frugal man. He can take the good with the bad,” Ms. Ke Wanni said. “We sometimes take some leftovers to him for dinner and his dog. However, he wouldn’t eat them. Instead, he stores some for the next meal to eat and gives more for his dog to eat, “ Ms.Ke said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he baked the leftovers under the sun in order to keep the meat fresh. “He is so frugal!” Ms. Ke said, praising Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Zhou suffered a serious hernia. He then pinched and scraped, in order to save more money to get back to his hometown in Anhui to take an operation and treatment. “Why did I go back to my hometown to have the operation? It’s just because the medical cost in Anhui is much more cheaper than in Shantou,” Zhou said. “Another reason is that I wanted to visit my elder sister in Anhui.” Zhou began to tear up as he related his hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lonely stranger in a strange land I am cast– I miss my sister all the time on every festive day,” he said, wiping away tears. His elder sister is more than ninety, Zhou’s only kin. He felt so sorry that he couldn’t earn enough money to help out his older sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s why I haven’t gone home for many years!” Zhou said with a little bit shame. “Until I earn enough money, I won’t go back to Anhui!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, Zhou woke up early, as usual. In order to collect more scrap, he quickly rode his tricycle to Tuopu in darkness. Hesitating for a few seconds, he stopped beside the gate of one store and began to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is darkest before the dawn!” Zhou said. Zhou waited alone in the dark. Nearby, shadows of the street lamps flickered on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hundreds Come to Pray to a Local Heroine</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/hundreds-come-to-pray-to-a-local-heroine.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Emma Lu and Haimei Ou&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line of people climbed up the mountain for about 25 minutes, drawing close to the center of the low mountain. A grand scene was before them: a huge crowd of people were busy praying, the puppet show of the Chao Opera was playing in front of the graveyard, and innumerable firecrackers were hung to be set off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all for the grave of Mrs. Zhuang. The grave was at a high position with various meat offerings in front of it, and dozens of big burning incense sticks inserted into the soil which covered it. Paper money and incense burned together, filling the air with smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the grand ceremony to honor Mrs Zhuang, who lived in Song Dynasty. It brought hundreds and perhaps even thousands of her offspring to worship together. The celebration falls near the traditional Chinese festival of Grave-Sweeping Day, a day when departed ancestors are honored and their graves cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebration for Mrs Zhuang is not on Grave-Sweeping Day, but on the February 8th of the lunar calendar, which is close to the Grave-Sweeping Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grave-Sweeping Day is an important traditional festival in China. It is usually around April 5th each year. People go to their ancestors’ graveyard to honor the dead on this day. In the Chaoshan area, the day holds great importance. People serve lots of Chaoshan food as an offering to their ancestors, as well as invite some Chao Opera groups to perform at their ancestors’ grave sites. They not only go to worship their close family, such as their parents or grandparents, but also go with some more distant relatives to worship their ancient ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, on the early morning of the Zhuang clan gathering, cars and motorbikes, as well as several buses, pasted with placards reading “Zhuang’s Ancestor Worship,” went up Peasant Road. The road led to low mountains, called the Sangpu Mountains, where the Zhuang graveyard lay. Several policemen were standing by to manage the traffic. A banner reading “Welcome to Overseas Clan Member for Ancestor Worship”was hung at the entrance to the graveyard, greeting the many overseas Chinese that had come back for the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The departed ancestor being celebrated, Mrs Zhuang, was a heroine whose story is one of family devotion and bringing her descendent glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2004 book named Chaoshan Cultural Reporting by Xinrong Hu, explains the story: more than 700 years ago, Mrs Zhuang hung herself from a beam for the sake of acquiring the precious graveyard where she is lying now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chaoshan people have a deep-rooted belief in &lt;em&gt;feng shui&lt;/em&gt;, and regard it as very important to one’s fortune. Mrs Zhuang’s father-in-law discovered the Sangpu range by accident, and believed that if a dead person could be buried in this place, his offspring would be glorious and affluent. However, he was troubled with the fact that the place did not belong to him, but belonged to Mrs Zhuang’s father’s village. So, by the logic of local traditions, if Mrs Zhuang went back to her father and mother’s home and died there, the father-in-law would have a good reason to ask for a grave site in the Sangpu area for Mrs Zhuang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, Mrs Zhuang was just over 40 years old. When she heard of her father-in-law’s wish, she took her own life. She was buried in the Sangpu Mountains, and the clan she had married into acquired the precious burial site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book “Chaoshan Cultural Reporting” says that the shape of the Sangpu Mountains is like the a sleeping female dog, called a sleeping dog aperture, and the graveyard of Mrs Zhuang lies on the genitalia of this female dog. That is why Mrs Zhuang’s offspring have been so numerous, traditional belief holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also said that now thousands of Mrs Zhuang’s offspring live mainly in the east of Guangdong and Hong Kong, and the east and south of Asia. Some of them are very successful: Shiping Zhuang, is the former vice chairman of the Overseas Chinese Association in Hong Kong and one of the important founders of Shantou University; Jing’an Zhuang, who was a successful businessman in Hong Kong and was the father-in-law of Li Ka Shing; Lixiang Zhuang, who was the former Party Secretary of Shantou city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, on the February 8 of the lunar calendar, all the Zhuang clan come from different places to worship Mrs Zhuang, because they think that their clan’s rapid development has something to do with the good &lt;em&gt;feng shui&lt;/em&gt; of the burial ground. Those who come to the burial ground have developed a ritual to honor their ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Zhuang clan members usually come to pray at midnight. Because they believe that if they worship during the first hour of Mrs Zhuang’s death day, which indicates their loyalty to the ancestor, it will make it easier for their wishes to be granted,” said Kailong Li, a teacher of Cheung Kong School of Art and Design at Shantou University who teaches a course on Chaoshan folk art and is an expert on local culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it is a kind of superstition, but I think it reflects the Chaoshan people’s mind of tending to live a safe and happy life,” he said, of the Zhuang family celebrations. “On the other hand, as the grave is on the ‘genitalia of the female dog,’ it is particularly “efficient’ for the wish of producing male babies, which is a very popular wish for Chaoshan people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Li said the worship for Mrs Zhuang was one of the most large-scale memorial ceremonies in Guangdong Province. However, the ceremony has become smaller and smaller in recent years. “Maybe because the importance of producing a male baby is changing, they would prefer to commemorate Mrs Zhuang as they do other ancestors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zhuang family gathering was followed in the weeks after it by the formal Grave-Sweeping Day, the first year the traditional ceremony was designed as a formal public holiday recognized by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Acquires Taste for Vino</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gz.ifeng.com/guangzhouzhuanti/hclub/ziliao/detail_2013_11/07/1432024_0.shtml&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/03/rdn_527b3ecdd3586.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo from gz.ifeng.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When night begins to fall, racks of dark reddish wine bottles shine through the soft-reflected light in an elegantly furnished wine store. The grape-like sheen the bottles give off can easily engage you with their bouquet, even through the cork-sealed bottles. This is the scene in retail wine stores dotting Longhu District, one of the most flourishing districts in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, the introduction of western lifestyle choices has ramped up the consumption of Western wine in Shantou; in the last four years, at least three wine stores and bars have opened here. The heating up of the local wine industry has quickly attracted the attention of visionary dealers in wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wine can be seen not only in star-rated hotels and high-end malls, but also in franchise stores. In a relatively affluent neighborhood in Shantou, Longhu District, there are three stores exclusively selling wine, namely Aussino World Wines, Wine Cellar and Vintage Wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly the three wine stores are small in scale, incorporating a bar, thermostats and tasting facilities. Customers are able to choose among a wide range of wine imported from France, Italy, Australia and other western countries. These shops have also set up wine bars equipped with cozy sofas for business negotiations and simply hanging out and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The main reasons for the rapid growth of the wine industry rest with the increase in the number of people with high income and more knowledge about wine,” said Jinrong Cai, marketing and sales director of Aussino World Wines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he considers most rewarding is not the growing sales, but consumers’ more comprehensive understanding of wine. “In the past, people knew little about red wine,” Cai told the reporter. “The decision they made on which wine to buy is subject to the price. However, things are different now. More and more customers have good taste in identifying fine wines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said another noticeable change in wine industry was simply more customers. The target consumers for red wine in Shantou used to be overseas Chinese who had been greatly influenced by western culture. These days, it has extended to white-collar workers, government officials and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, grape-based wine was not as popular in China as in the West; alcohol in China has a history of 5000 years, but traditional drinks like &lt;em&gt;baijiu&lt;/em&gt; are rice-based. But with China becoming the third biggest global market of luxuries, imported wine is making a play for equal share with traditional Chinese spirits. To join the fray, China has exploited its own growing districts of grapes, among which Changli of Hebei Province and Yantai of Shandong Province are the most famous ones. But wine produced in these areas still struggles to meet consumers’ high expectations of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign wine producers are also starting to see value in an Asian market. Christian Seely, marketing manager of AXA millesimes described in a recent Internet article how much French wine industry values Asian market:”The owners of Bordeaux vineyard meet more often in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore than in their hometowns,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both prices and import duties are making wine more affordable for the Chinese consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, most consumers favor the red wine priced at 100-300 yuan, according to staff at the three wine stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The import tariffs have been brought down several times,” said Haiming She, managing director of Vintage Wine. “The price difference of domestic wine and imported wine is negligible. In particular, red wine intermediate in price appeals to a collection of mid-range consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently a number of foreign countries serve as places of origin of wine on the market. “Though the long history of French, Spanish and German red wine has contributed tremendously to their fame,” said She, “a new booming generation of red wine from Australia, Chile and the United States has occupied a considerable share of the market in the last few years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with domestic wine, import wine offers a selection in place of origin, variety, taste, price and brand and aims for a developing high-end tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The sales of famous brand wine are usually in smaller scope,” said Vivian Wei, head of the Wine Cellar. “Thus the promotion pattern of import red wine is quite distinct from that of domestic wine. Several leading brands of import red wine put a high premium on exerting a subtle influence on consumers’ refined taste.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the customers keep coming in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yu Zhang, a supervisor of Hongqiao Packaging Industry Co., Ltd in Shantou, was picking out wine at the Wine Cellar. When asked why he showed preference for wine, he replied, “Drinking wine is a way of pursuing leisurely life. Most importantly, an occasional glass of&lt;br /&gt;
wine has been shown to benefit health. I read a report the other day saying a glass a day may help prevent prostate cancer – so why not raise my glass?”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toy Exports Take a Hit</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/toy-exports-take-a-hit.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 2, a Chinese financial newspaper &lt;em&gt;21st Century China Business Herald&lt;/em&gt; published a story titled “China toy industry meets an inflection point?”The story describes declines to the toy export industry here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story, Luo Yangpeng, vice-major of Shantou City admitted the growth of Shantou toy exportation would decline in 2008 because of multiple factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story reported a decline of Guangdong toy exportation for February, falling by 40.3%. It was 20.1% lower than a year before. It hit a new low after a series of toys recalls in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a combination of appreciation of the RMB, growth of cost and more strict standards for toy exportation, China toy industry is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linweji, a manager of Huawei Toys which is a big toy plant in Chenghai, Shantou, said foreign businessmen were unwilling to change the trading currency because of dollar devaluation. He complained that profits turned to losses after a few months as RMB had been rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing this situation, Shantou toy industry would improve its products’ quality by establishing a 10-million-yuan-worthy inspection center and would develop its new markets in Africa and Oceania, said Luo Yangpeng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10th China Chenghai International Exposition for Toys and Gifts is going to open at Chenghai Exhibition Centre on April 21 and last for 4 days, the Shantou Evening Post reports. Meanwhile, Chenghai, the China Toys and Gifts Center, will be setting up an Exhibition and Trade Center for Toys and Gifts all the year round, which will make it an “immortal” exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toy expo is sponsored by China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and Shantou Municipal Government, and undertaken by Chenghai District Government, CCPIT Shantou Branch, Chenghai Toys Association and Chenghai Arts and Crafts Association. 80% of the investment attracting plan had been fulfilled by the end of March. Merchants are reported to be quite interested in such a new mode of marketing that combines a regular exhibition and perennial sales exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Smuggled Animals Worth 67 million RMB Found</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/smuggled-animals-worth-67-million-rmb-found.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both Chinese and English media are reporting on the seizure of a huge number of smuggled wild animals discovered at a nearby port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of wild animals were discovered at a local port last month, after customs officials investigated a suspicious vessel, according to a QQ news story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a spokesman of the Shantou Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Ministry(CIQ) in the story, an illegal fishing boat had docked in Chenghai. The CIQ raided the vessel and discovered the smuggled animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of nationally protected wild animals worth about 67 million RMB were discovered. In total, there were 5776 monitor lizards, 260 Malaysian box turtles, 1170 cobras, and 370 giant Asian pond turtles discovered. Unfortunately, most animals had died in captivity. Most of the captured animals were buried or burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such animals are popular in cuisine here and are believed to bring health benefits to those who eat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2000 judicial interpretation, criminals should be sentenced to life imprisonment or even the death penalty for smuggling four monitor lizards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Performance Art to Protect an Old House</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hand in hand, forming a big word “NO,”40 young people gathered in front of Xiangyuan House and used performance art to protect the old house from tearing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiangyuan House is a European style building in the old section of the city. It was built as a personal house during the period of the Republic of China (1921-1949), and became public property in 1949. Now it is a kindergarten under the threat of being demolished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity to protect it was organized online by an activist with the nickname “Exploring Frog.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Land from the Sea</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/land-from-the-sea.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Local media are reporting on a large land reclamation project set to take place across the province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 3, the government of Guangdong Province held a news conference to announce that 24 places will reclaim land from the sea, including Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou plans to reclaim 20 square kilometers, an area equal to the size of the current city. Li Zhujiang,head of the Oceans and Fisheries Department of Guangdong Province said that Zhuhai City would reclaim the most land. Shantou will reclaim the second most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is set to reclaim roughly 146 square kilometers of coastline, an aread about 5.5 times that of Macao ,China, and has a target completion deadline of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reclaimed land will be used for ports and industrial zones, mainly for developing energy, petrolchemistry, shipbuilding, and the steel industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Junior High Student Shooting in Chenghai</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/junior-high-student-shooting-in-chenghai.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A junior high school student was shot by a classmate and sustained serious injury on the evening of April 2nd in Chenghai District, according to a report in a local newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shooting happened as a result of conflict between Yu and Du, both students at Suwan Middle School in Chenghai District.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the description by police given in the news reports, the two students called for gangs of their friends to fight near the gate of their school at about 4:00pm of April 2nd, but were stopped by a teacher. After that, when Du and his two friends were walking home, they were beaten by an older teenager, a friend of Yu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After negotiating over the phone, Yu and Du, along with their own “gangs” agreed to meet at night on a playground of Chenghai District. Around 9:00 pm, Du saw Yu and six other people heading for the venue by motorcycle, and he called his older friend. This older friend brought four friends with guns to the scene, and shot Yu, who was sitting on the back of a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chenghai police sent Yu to the hospital immediately and began an investigation. By 3:00am of April 4, the policemen had caught the five older teenagers in an internet bar on Gold New North Road of downtown Shantou. The case is under further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Family Thrives Yet Doubts in Pollution Town</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/family-thrives-yet-doubts-in-pollution-town.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Meisheng Chen’s memory, about twenty years ago, there were green fields in Guiyu. Every day, farmers furrowed fields with water buffalos, and fed their chickens and ducks in front of their houses. When night fell, the aroma of rice and fish wafted through town. There were two wells in the town, and all the residents gathered water their water at them. Water there was sweet and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now facing the place she has lived for almost thirty years, Chen seems hesitant. Under the hot sunshine, the city is filled with the smell of burning plastic and electronics. The residents living in the center of the town have to bear a stinking river in front of government buildings. Some residents said the groundwater was polluted, oil having contaminated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guiyu town, once a rural community, has become one of the biggest distribution centers of electronic recycled parts in China. Residents run family-operated businesses collecting all kinds of electronic goods. They burn or strip down electronics, extract valuable parts and metals, and resell the parts and metals for cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the industry that has made some families here wealthy has also caused serious pollution; the index of a highly poisonous toxins in the soil of Guiyu is 28 times higher than garbage dumps in the Philippines, according to Croucher Institute for Environmental Sciences and Biology of the Baptist University of Hong Kong.The highly poisonous toxins coming from chemical compounds left over from incineration and can cause skin disease and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A serious pollution problem may only get worse this year, as hundreds of thousands of old televisions are set to be dumped in Guiyu as Hong Kong switches to high definition televisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Dec.31, 2007, Hong Kong officially started digital broadcasting, and citizens are trading in old televisions for the high definition televisions (HDTV). About 460,000 old TV sets will be thrown away in Guiyu and Taizhou, according to Yongzhi Ou, the director of environmental affairs in the NGO Friends of the Earth, said in a recent China Radio International report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of the Earth said that most of the old TV sets use the Cathode-ray tubes-CRT, which contain five highly poisonous heavy metals and chemical elements: lead, phosphorous, cadmium, barium and mercury. When these materials are burned, heated or melted, the highly poisonous toxins and other poisonous gas will be released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Chen, whose family profits from the electronic recycling business, admits Guiyu’s problems are serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The recycling can help to make money, but it does cause pollution here,” said Chen. Chen, a local in Guiyu, has lived here almost for 30 years with her husband, mother-in-law and three children. Three years ago, she started a family-run business in the industrial park in Huamei village of Guiyu. She seldom travels to other place because it is so busy since her factory opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Chen’s conservative estimate, the electronic junk recycling business would bring 50,000 to 60,000 yuan net profit per year to her family.”I know there will be a little poisonous gas and it causes some pollution when we heat the circuit broads,” Chen said. “In general, the whole production process is safe.”&lt;br /&gt;
Chen’s family was a farming family before getting into electronics recycling. Before opening her factory, she recycled in a small house. As the business heated up, the space in her home was not enough so she decided to rent a bigger place for the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her factory, she is in charge of workers who break boards into parts and then sell them to customers. Her husband is in charge of purchasing all kinds of circuit wafers of household appliances from Nanhai or Guangzhou. Discarded electronics are purchased by the ton from the big trucks that roll into the town once a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junk bought by the ton will then be separated into two main kinds, reusable parts and junk parts. Resuable parts such as silicon chips, LEDs and IC chips are sold to electronics factories. Junk parts are sold to individual middlemen, who often ride motorcycles to collect parts door to door and then transport them to the a nearby electroplate factory which distills metals from them, especially gold and copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maoyong Huang, the Deputy Major of Guiyu, who is in charge of the development of electronic junk recycling, said Guiyu started the electronic junk recycling industry in the middle of 1990s and purchased traditional things like metal and plastic at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are over 140,000 workers taking part in recycling but most of the business are ran by families, which means family members join in production in their family factory,” he said. “They lack the knowledge and technique of recycling, which is the main reason of causing pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Guiyu suffers from the effects of the electronic scrap industry, Huang sees it as a kind of service.”Recycling can save about two millions tons of petrol and three millions tons of ore for the country every year,” said Mr. Huang proudly. “We pollute ourselves but help reduce the pollution to the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents don’t seem worried about any possible deleterious effects that more junk scrapping of old TVs might bring. Chen said imported junk was very popular and demand exceeds supply in Guiyu. “The rubbish trucks come and a crowd of people rush to them,” she said.&lt;br /&gt;
The most prized discarded electronics come from countries outside China, valued for the parts and metals which can be extracted from them.”Our rubbish is mainly from foreign countries. Like the American plates are purchased about for fifty-sixty thousands yuan per ton and the South Korea’s are forty thousands yuan per ton,” she said. “We seldom purchase the domestic-made rubbish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guo, another local businessman in Nanyang village of Guiyu township, said that the quality of the domestically-made rubbish made it hard to distill precious metals from it. “Hong Kong trash is good. I like to purchase it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he too is aware of the problems that come from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know the pollution here is serious,” Guo said. “But we have no choice. All the people here are doing this for living.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Huang, the deputy mayor, explained that the local government didn’t know the rubbish came from foreign countries or Hong Kong.”Our junk is mainly from the Pearl River Delta,” he said. “We don’t have a system to locate the rubbish source, but we will set up this system soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meisheng Chen, the woman with the family business, has mixed feelings about Guiyu and its industry. Though Chen insisted that there was a little pollution during the heating process, she hated people who threw garbage into the river and didn’t contribute any money to protect their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She and her husband support a sick mother-in-law on their income, and their three children are in school. But they live in a community where the glory of making money is tainted with greed and grime. In the old days, residents helped each other, according to Chen. Once they became rich from the rubbish recycling business, Chen said, there was only money in their eyes and they forgot the environment of their hometown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If I could choose my future,” she said, pausing, “I would give up the high-income and go back to the old days so that we would live a happy life together.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intellectual Property Rights Conference</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/intellectual-property-rights-conference.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sipo.gov.cn/dtxx/gn/2008/200804/t20080401_363544.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016/04/W020080401580756072922.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo from sipo.gov.cn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meeting to develop intellectual property rights awareness and promote small business was held in Shantou last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “2008 Guangdong/Hong Kong Seminar on Intellectual Property and the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (Shantou)” was jointly organized by the Guangdong Provincial Intellectual Property Office, the Municipal Government of Shantou City and the Intellectual Property Department of the HKSAR Government, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) at Junhua hotel in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening of March. 26th, Municipal CPC Committee and government held a welcome ceremony for the leaders and experts. Zhiguang Huang, Party Secretary of Shantou, Yaoguang Su, vice mayor attended the ceremony, and had an in-depth discussion and exchange of views on the further strengthening of the Hong Kong-Guangdong cooperation in intellectual property rights, creating a good environment for the development of intellectual property, promoting the usage of IT to increase the small and medium Enterprises competitiveness with Sufang Xie, Hong Kong Director of Intellectual Property, Li Qingxiong Head of customer service of HKTDC, according to Shantou Daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar is one of the cooperation projects launched by the Hong Kong-Guangdong cooperation in the protection of intellectual property task force, and it is an important activity of Guangdong-Hong Kong economic and trade cooperation.

      <title>Oil Shortage in Chaozhou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/oil-shortage-in-chaozhou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many gas stations in Chaozhou are running short on gas these days. According to one of the crew members who works at a gas station near the Chao-Shan Highway, their station used to get diesel oil from their company every day. But they get nothing these days. What’s worse, gas stations in surrounding areas ran out of gas one after the other recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analyst in the Department of Economy and Trading of Chaozhou said that the price of international crude oil keeps rising, which  impacts the price of domestic oil.The gap between wholesale oil and retail oil is shrinking.Retail oil in some places is even higher than wholesale oil.Some stations therefore cut the supply to save money. Drivers have said that they hope that the government will soon come up with solutions to balance the oil supply.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liquid Goods Prohibited on Shantou Domestic Flights</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/liquid-goods-prohibited-in-shantou-domestic-flights.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shantou Airport has implemented a new regulation, forbidding passengers to carry liquid goods with them on the domestic flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A staff member of the Shantou Airport security checkpoint said that besides common liquids, like water and drinks, the liquid items prohibited from being carried will also include soup, cream, lotion, toothpaste, perfume, shaving cream, aerosol and jelly. The new rule was put forward by CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight will provide the passengers who have babies with them liquid food, like milk, if they apply when buying tickets. Diabetics or other patients, who need liquid drugs, can ask the flight staff to keep the drug after providing their medical records and passing a security check, according to the Shantou Airport authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International and regional flights still follow the old rule issued by CAAC on March 17, 2007. The CAAC also announced that airports should double check the passengers’ luggage by instruments and staff, if necessary, to ensure the air transport security.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Overseas Chinese Seek Business Opportunities in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/overseas-chinese-seek-business-opportunities-in-shantou.html</link>

&lt;p&gt;The association consists of more than 300 corporations, enterprises and factories engaged in the plastics industry, toy manufacturing, raw materials and import and export trade. It is a local association with strong economic strength and great social impact, all of whose members are from Chaozhou.

      <title>&quot;Writing Help&quot; Shop Fades Into the Past</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/writing-help-shop-fades-into-the-past.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;http://news.myshantou.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/vicki_writing_shop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Writing Help&amp;quot; Shop Fades Into the Past&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At No.43 Old Park Front Road in Shantou, there is a small shop with works of calligraphy pasted all over it. A man over seventy is waving a brush in his right hand and writing a big Chinese character – “chan” which means “zen,” on white paper. When he finishes writing, he makes a wood chop. He dips the chop in red ink and stamps the lower right corner of the paper. Two red characters show “Qiu Hu” clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qiu Hu is the boss of this 6-square-metre shop. In the front of his shop, there is a one meter high board with three big red characters â€“ “Dai Xie Chu.” It means something like “Writing Help Shop,” a place that helps people write letters, couplets, correspondence, contracts, applications, agreements of both marriage and divorce, and so on. A variety of service contents are listed at his shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is the only writing helping shop in the old city of Shantou,” Qiu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing help shops were common in China throughout an era when many people could not read or write. In 1949, illiterates and semi-literates consisted of 80% of the population. Today, with development of education and modern technology, the use of writing shops has dropped off. Still Qiu sees value in offering writing help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why did I want to open this shop? The most important reason was that I wanted to use my own advantages to help people, especially the poor ones,” Qiu said, “And of course, I can make money from my writing – it means that I am still useful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qiu was born in 1931, and he has been retired for more than 17 years. When he was young, he went to Hainan for some years, then worked in a very poor rural town in Sichuan in construction. When Qiu was 60 years old, he retired and returned to Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Qiu was retiring, he still wanted to use his knowledge to help people. The first idea that came to mind wasâ€””Dai Xie.” That was because Qiu loved calligraphy very much and he had had some publicity experience in his work unit. At that time, there were few “Dai Xie” shop in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning, Qiu comes to his small shop at about nine o’clock and awaits customers.Ten years ago, Qiu was very busy. Many people came to his shop asking him to help write letters; some came to him for legal indictment help. Qiu’s standard charge was no more than sixty yuan; some jobs were even free. His service was much cheaper than asking an expert for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Qiu opened his shop,he didn’t have much knowledge about the law, so he bought some books and taught himself. Many books such as “How To Write A Couplet,” “Legal Instruments,” “How To Have A Good Name” and so on sit on Qiu’s bookshelf. Qiu said, “When I encounter something I don’t know, I will read the books to find the answers. Then I ask for professional opinions – it makes me think more and learn more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, fewer people come to the Writing Help shop, but sometimes Qiu is still busy as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A few days ago, many people came to ask me to help them fill out the application form of the low-income groups in Shantou city. They were mainly middle-aged people; they did not know how to fill them in, so they came to me for help. A long queue was up the street. I didn’t even have time for a meal,” Qiu said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qiu’s family has lived in the Little Park since Chinese liberation in 1949, so Qiu opened his shop in front of his house at the very beginning. Because of the transformation of Little Park, he has to spend 200 yuan per month to rent this small shop to continue his business. With an eight-hundred yuan pension per month, Qiu can feed himself even if the writing shop does not draw business. He can foresee a not-too distant time when his writing-help days will end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘Dai Xie’ is coming to an end because of the development of technology. The communication equipment and the computer technology have developed so superbly and is so widespread that people will no longer need to write by paying someone. You can just search on the computer. It is very convenient,” Qiu said. “I am 78 years old already, and I don’t have enough energy to continue with this shop. At most, another two years, I think – then I will close this shop, and ‘Dai Xie’ will fall into history.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Young Artists Sell Hand-Painted Shoes</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/young-artists-sell-hand-painted-shoes.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://news.myshantou.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_0073.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_0073.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao unzipped his backpack, took out a pair of blank sneakers and some painting brushes. His fellow Zhou was setting up storage racks and put up a poster saying “Jinxuan Graffiti” beside them. A noodle seller was saying goodbye to them. He had just finished picking up his movable noodle shop to make room for these two young men’s hand-painted shoes stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple roadside stand was made up of an table, four stools and storage racks. Zhou said he had made the storage racks by himself using extra materials in the supermarket where he worked. After graduating from a local art and design college, Zhou has been a poster-designer in Lotus Supercenter in Shantou for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhou and Xiao have sold hand-painted shoes near Jinsha Park every Sunday afternoon for 4 months. They called the shoes “DIY (DO IT YOURSELVES)”works which are cloth shoes with hand-painted images on the sneakers. The interest the shoes attract is evidence of a youth culture that has its roots in big urban centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hand-painted shoes started to be sold in Shantou later than other big cities in Guangdong like Guangzhou and Zhuhai. Our products attract many pedestrians, especially young people who stop and look for what is new. But few will buy the shoes. The notion of the local people is different from other cities,” XiaoLiangjin, 23, said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shoes sell for about 60 RMB, considerably more than the 40 yuan that sneakers can go for in many shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao likes to draw delicate girl portraits or abstract paintings, while Zhou likes to draw pop style images and characters. Also they can draw what customers request. Xiao said they had been trying to set up their own business by using their painting and designing abilities. Zhou indicated he did not care how much they earned but just enjoyed the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao graduated 5 years ago from a Wuhan (an inland city in Hubei Province) art and design school. Now he is employed by a quite big design company in Tuopu Shantou as a designer. He has to work for 6 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we step into the company on weekdays, we must devote ourselves in the work forgetting any other things. We sell ourselves to the bosses,”he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhou followed, “Only on this afternoon of every Sunday can we do what we enjoy doing. So we don’t care how much money we make, we do it for art and an attitude of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, Zhou and Xiao sat and kept eyes down working on the shoes-painting in hands, quiet without talking to each other, even if there were people around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They planed to sell shoes and other painting products on “Taobao”, a customer to customer trading website. If their business is fully funded, they will open the first “Box Shop” in Shantou which provides boxes for people to have their own goods showed in and sold. Box shops are popular in some big cities in China after first being introduced from Hong Kong last year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maggie returned!  (Very briefly, and in January)</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/maggie-returns-very-briefly-and-in-january.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I should’ve written earlier, but I actually visited Shantou in January (08!) for a week - a whirlwind of meals and visits and one night of hard drinking. It was for my friend Henry’s wedding. I never actually made it to the wedding - had to get back up north the same day - but I spent time with him and his wife (Ella), and saw all my friends and ex-colleagues! No really great pics or stories, just old friends meeting up and being happy. Although we did unearth a cafe which I’ll write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry, me, Ella. Congratulations! And they’re going to have a baby, too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very well done cafe/tea house/bar, quiet but not boring, balcony with a sea view, a design company owns it (I think!) - it shares the premises! So the design is tasteful, and not tacky. Unfortunately I didn’t get a picture and we never got around to going back. Hopefully it won’t go out of business if it has the support of the design company! Jiayou quiet bars in Shantou!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Afternoon in the Pu</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/an-afternoon-in-the-pu.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/an-afternoon-in-the-pu.html/tuopu-kids-2jpg/&quot; title=&quot;tuopu-kids-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2075/2331651324_33505b9705.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only half an hour into our walk through the Pu, we had a group of about twenty teenage boys trailing us and shouting at ear-splitting volume. This is what it feels like to be a celebrity, I thought. This is what it would be like if I were Ben Affleck and showed up at the local mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I headed out on a recent afternoon to what the foreign community here affectionately refers to as “the Pu,” Tuopu, one of the many small villages on the outskirts of the city that have been subsumed under urban sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pu lies out on Daxue Lu, University Road. It is a smallish community, set against a dark river into which people dump their trash. Tuopu is a mix of old-style Chinese houses set close together, and apartments of Soviet bloc architecture. As you go further from the main road, the spaces widen; rough gardens and fields of crops appear. A friend tells me that in the local language, there is a slur against people who live there that translates something close to “Tuopu hillbilly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an afternoon walking around there, though, and getting treated like rock stars, it seems an unfair assessment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is true of the Pu, however, is that it seems to be a place in a city – where traffic is generally of the Mad Max variety – of even more boundless traffic freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hopped off a bus and immediately were nearly run over by several motorcycles. We had heard that down the side alleys, parallel to the river, were some interesting old buildings. We found one and headed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were quickly in a tunnel-like alley, where buildings seemed to lean in on each other. Kids on bicycles whirred by in twos and threes. The occassional motorcyle pinned us against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They have school on Saturday?’ I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No not really,” my girlfriend, Moon, replied. “They just have to study all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering her stories of the bootcamp nature of Chinese high school, it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few bends in a few different alleys, I saw what was clearly a cross poking up out of a mass of buildings. We walked over and sure enough: Tuopu Church. I added it to the list of five or six Christian churches I’d already seen throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking on we came across a stone monument that had dates of 1120 and 1201 carved into it. Apparently, the area had been of importance to trade in the southern Song dynasty. I looked around at the dusty houses and fields. It was hard to imagine the sleepy suburb being a hub of trade, but a lot can change in 800 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned around and met our companions for the next hour or so, Jia Kun and his friends. We had turned away from the monument, and found one of the kids who had been trailing us on a bike peering up at us with wide eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey buddy, what’s up?” I said. He grinned and said something in dialect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry we don’t speak your dialect, but we can speak Putonghua,” I said in Chinese. He seemed to take a foreigner speaking Chinese in stride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He launched into an explanation of why he and his friends had been trailing us for the last twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“March is Lei Feng month. Our teacher told us we should do a good thing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lei Feng was a model, mythological Communist soldier who helped others at his own expense. “Lei Feng shu shu” translated roughly into something like “do-gooder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So what is the good thing you want to do?” asked Moon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to show you the road,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, local guides. We were set. We followed Jia Kun on a tour of Tuopu, a tour that consisted mostly of his school and collecting a flock of teenage boys on bikes at every house that we passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a walk that nearly took us back to the university, we made it to Jia Kun’s school, Tuo Dong Xuexiao. Although the school was closed, we were suddenly swarmed by another twenty or so teenage kids. One in particular was a character. “Si-KU-le!!!” he kept shouting, a version of “school” adapted into his native tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell immediately into my role as teacher. “What is your name?” I asked the shouting comedian kid. “Yi Yan Bing!” he screamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How old are you?” I asked. There was much chatter about what I was asking at every question. Then an answer was formulated in Putonghua. One kid usually knew the English equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Yi Yan Bing came up with his answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shi si,” he said. “Fourteen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretended to misunderstand. “Si shi?!! Zhende ma? Ni shi si shi sui? Zenme ke neng?” I said. “You’re forty years old? How’s that possible?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This elicited the great gales of laughter that I had hoped for. Ohhhh, fourteen, not forty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys took us over to their uncle’s place, where they played billiards on tables that had little net holders under each pocket.&lt;br /&gt;
But no women were allowed into the place, and as it was International Women’s Day, it seemed inappropriate to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to escape from the boys, who seemed to be replicating in numbers at every moment. We said our goodbyes and headed down the road. But after about a minute, we found ourselves surrounded again by kids on bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we reached DaXue Lu again, we came across the &lt;em&gt;qilin&lt;/em&gt; on the side of the small temple. But it was mostly blocked by a car and the boys, sensing my interest, went into a shouting fest about how there was another. They took us to the back of the temple where there was indeed, a magnificent fresco of the strange creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qilin was a mythological Chinese beast, with the hooves of horse, the body of a deer, and a single horn. It was supposed to be an omen of luck; I had been reading Gavin Menzies controversial book &lt;em&gt;1421&lt;/em&gt; and had been intrigued by the fact that one of the treasure ships had brought back giraffes to the Ming emperor and had presented them as qilins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snapped some pictures and the boys led us on. I couldn’t help grinning at the kids. They were loud. They were obnoxious. But their enthusiasm was infectious. For a variety of reasons, I had been filled with sadness over the past few days, and had been waking up with sickening nightmares. After an hour or so just hanging out with the kids, I felt lifted out of myself. It was hard to be anything but happy in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jia Kun sped off down the alley. He was waiting for us at the main street. He explained to us where we were, and we pretended that we hadn’t known and were grateful for his explanation. He was wearing a black sweatshirt that had “Turbo Charge Cataly at” on the back, in the usual and always surprising English found here. I chuckled as I looked at his feet and we waved goodbye – his outfit was completed by a pair of pink “Hello Kitty” slip-on sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Port Establishes Mediterranean Route</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-port-establishes-mediterranean-route.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A ceremony celebrating the maiden voyage of the Shantou port-Mediterranean international container liner route was held at Guang’ao harbor on March, 7, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sea route is a true international container route, which will increase local imports and exports, enhance the capacity of Shantou port, and even contribute to the Shantou economy, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international container liner route links 12 sea ports from 8 countries, which are Shanghai(China), Pusan (South Korea), Shantou (China), Kelang (Malaysia), Damietta (Egypt), Naples (Italy), the Rijeka (The Republic of Croatia)and Koper (The Republic of Slovenia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first voyage of this route was carried out by the “Orchid” of the CMA CGM Shipping Company from France, a 222.1 meter vessel. The total tonnage of “Orchid” is 39,000 tons and with 2,800-TEU container vessels on the ship. (TEU, Twenty foot Equivalent Units, express a measurement in the shipping industry; a common container size is twenty feet in length, eight feet high, and six feet in length.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CMA CGM Shipping Company has plans to launch other international container liner routes between Shantou and the Mediterranean Sea. The volume of goods is expected to rise to 200,000 TEUs annually in total.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a note of clarification on writing credits here. All the recent news summaries are written by Shantou J-school students – not by me, as the photo and the title “author” on its side might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a technical glitch that we’ll hopefully work out soon when all bloggers and contributors get individual user IDs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chenghai to Produce Toys for CCTV Cartoons</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chenghai-to-produce-toys-for-cctv-cartoons.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By: Yamaha Gong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chenghai, a Shantou satellite community and industrial area, has established a cooperative operation with CCTV to produce toys based on CCTV cartoons, according to an agreement reached on February 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a famous toy production base and one of the most important export cities in China, Chenghai gained the designation “Chinese Toy City” in 2003. Companies have been encouraged to strengthen ties with cartoon makers from all over the world, said the Chenghai government. Chenghai was chosen as the partner because it has stable toy industries and paid lots of attention to toy creation and brand, said the related-project manager of the CCTV cartoon limited company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For promoting their cooperation, the Chenghai government will devote eighteen million yuan as special funds to support the cartoon industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Food Blogs</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-food-blogs.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two new links have appeared in the links column of this webpage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.stu.edu.cn/diane/&quot;&gt;Have You Eaten Yet?&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.stu.edu.cn/jou4390/&quot;&gt;Food Writing Class blog&lt;/a&gt;. Both blogs are all about food in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou is renowned for its Chaoshan cuisine, but the blogs go into all aspects of eating in Shantou – recent posts discuss everything from Sichuan hotpot to Brazilian barbecue (in Shantou?!! Yes, who woulda thunk it?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word has it that China Daily will do a feature article on the blogs and English food writing in Shantou, so connoisseurs of the delicious should keep their eyes peeled for that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By: Joanne Lau&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An H5N1 related case was discovered on February 25th in Shanwei, a city to the south of Shantou. The patient, a 44 year-old woman from Sichuan province, died as a result of the disease. She had worked at a brick factory in Haifeng County, Shanwei City. A report found that she had been with dead poultry before her clinical symptoms emerged. Thus far, no reports of similar symptoms among people who had been close to the patient before the death have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://myshantou.net/olympic-ceremony-and-bike-ride-on-sunday.html</link>

&lt;p&gt;A ceremony to mark the “Chinese Olympic Traveling Year” will be held in Shantou on March 2nd in the square in front of Shantou city swimming pool. At the same time, one thousand bicycle-riders will take part in a bicycle riding competition during the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2008 Chinese Olympic Traveling Year, a nationwide traveling theme publicized in 2008, was announced by the China Travel Bureau under the slogan “Olympic Games Meet in China Beijing.” In order to get into the Olympic spirit, the Shantou government decided to hold the ceremony, according to the Shantou Special Zone Evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole distance of the bicycle-riding competition is about 20 kilometers. From the starting point of the Shantou city swimming pool, the bicycle riders will be going along Nanbing Road, Tiangong Mountain, Shuangquan Park, Fuqian Road and finally end up at Zhongxin Vacation Village. Bicycle-interested competitors from other cities and countries like Korea will participate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happy Chinese New Year 2008</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/happy-chinese-new-year-2008.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit late to give our new year’s greeting here, but late is better than never! We wish all our blog readers and visitors enjoyed the New Year vocation and ready to welcome a fantastic 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few changes in Myshantou.net in 2007. Maggie &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/maggies-resignation.html&quot;&gt;left our blogger team&lt;/a&gt; in June last year to Qingdao to further her studies in Chinese and education. From a few emails with her, I can tell she’s enjoying what she is doing and doing a pretty good job. I wish 2008 will be an even better year for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of you may have noticed, there are a lot of new posts from ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/?author=5&quot;&gt;ZhongYuan&lt;/a&gt;’ and ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/?author=6&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;’. Yes, I was glad to have them joined our team to give us some up-to-date news on Shantou. ZhongYuan (as a preferred pen name, &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-bitter-melon.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt;) is a lecturer in journalism in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stu.edu.cn/eng/about.asp&quot;&gt;University of Shantou&lt;/a&gt;. Martin is one of the outstanding students in his class. Since they joined, both of them have contribute 32 posts covering various topics, all of them are quality over quantity! I’ve updated our &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page for the latest updates and members of our team. If you would like to join us, please don’t hesitate to drop an email!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About myself, I’ve been keeping my eyes on feedback and comments that we received through email and blog comments, while maintaining the blog. Thank you for all of you who asked questions and expressed your interest in Shantou. I’m really glad that this blog has become a mean of communication rather than one-way story giving. However I would like to apology if I’m not able to answer your question quickly, because I’m currently working in London and there is limited time that I can contribute to this blog. We will work out a way to distribute our resources more effectively in order to answer questions and help our visitors, so please don’t hold your comments or opinions, just say it out, we would like to hear!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008 there will be more exciting changes and news coming up and I’m very excited about it. Subscribe to us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=180516&amp;amp;loc=en_US&quot;&gt;by email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/Myshantou&quot;&gt;our feed&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you won’t miss out! If you have stories to share, contact us! Once again, wish you have an amazing 2008!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zhongshan Zoo Opens again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The zoo in Zhongshan Park will open again this month, after having been nearly doubled in size. Elephants, zebras and hippos have been added to the animal collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1954, it was the only zoo in east of Guangdong. There used to be over 40 kinds of animals in it in the 1970s. But it was so small that fewer and fewer visitors came. The zoo could not afford to raise animals and to buy new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renovation of the zoo started on July 20, 2007. Cooperating with an animal training team from Henan province, the zoo put 6 million yuan into this project. The size of it was extended from 6500 square meters to 11000 square meters. New cages and stages were also built. A number of new animals such as elephants, zebras and hippos will be on display.

      <link>https://myshantou.net/xia-shen-railway-builds.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An opening ceremony for the Xia-Shen Railway (section in Guangdong) was held in the town of Shaxi in Chao’an on January 6, 2008. The Xia-Shen Railway is a new railway connecting Shantou and two other Special Economic Zones, Xiamen and Shenzhen. It will take only two hours to go to Xiamen or Shenzhen from Shantou by train after it is built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five stations will be built in Chaoshan, including Raoping, Longdu (Chenghai), Shaxi (Chaozhou), Gurao (Chaoyang) and Puning. The section in Fujian has been under construction since last November. The whole project is predicted to be finished in 2011.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five coaches from Shantou were selected to participate in the Beijing Olympics. Three of them are sailing coaches from Shantou Sports School, including Chen Wenbo, Yu Yanyan and Du Ruojia. The other two are Huang Miaohua who teaches swimming and Chen Huayi who teaches shooting. It’s predicted that more coaches from Shantou will play a role in the Olympics before it is held.

      <title>Our Ma Jia Jue</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/our-ma-jia-jue.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A stunning story out of the English-language press yesterday about the abduction and murder of a 15-year old boy here by his classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, he was the son of a local businessman and the classmates intended to hold the youth for ransom. The Guardian has a fairly comprehensive story &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2236312,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;amp;feed=12&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing particularly Shantou-related about the crime; it could have happened anywhere, it seems to me. A source in the Guardian story seems to imply that tTV and crime films are to blame, and that the situation in Guangdong is worse than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something about this crime reminds me of another shocker a few years back, the story of Ma Jia Jue. That brutal killing took place in Yunnan. Ma was a Yunnan University student who murdered several of his classmates, ostensibly over losing a card game. A bit like the Virginia Tech killings or Columbine killers, Ma had been mentally unstable for some time before he finally cracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These horrible crimes can happen anywhere – we’re all too familiar with them in the U.S. In China, the greatest shock may be to realize they can happen here as well. If anything good comes out of it, it may be a public discussion about the event, such as the debate that occurred after the Yunnan University incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, if anyone hears about it: Is this being reported in the Chinese media? I certainly hope so. To sweep the bad stuff like this under the rug and pretend it isn’t there contributes to a kind of pyschological timebomb on on a societal scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Birthday of Umi Lazim</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-birthday-of-umi-lazim.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Umi Lazim teaches English in her free time. She has got time to kill, but it is not particularly free: She is on death row in a local prison for bringing heroin into the country, and today is her 24th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she is lucky, she will celebrate the rest of her birthdays behind bars. If not, she has just a few more to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazim is a Malaysian citizen who had graduated from university just months before she got on a plane and flew into Shantou airport nearly a year ago with 2.98 kilograms of heroin in her luggage, say reports in the Malaysian and Singaporean press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is one of a number of young women from Malaysia who have become drug mules, according to the articles, for international drug syndicates. Young women are attracted to jobs promising international travel, the reports say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Straits Times recently reported that the number of foreign citizens arrested for drug smuggling offenses in Guangdong has tripled in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guangdong has long been a site for smuggling because of its extensive coastline and proximity to Hong Kong and southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazim recently received a visit from her parents who were granted visiting rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to teaching English in jail, reports indicate that she has become proficient in Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Sports Park and a Sports Center were planned in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, a circular that outlines economic and social development every five years from 1953.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the plan, a Sports Park will be built on east of Songshan Road in town. It covers an area of about 260,000 square meters and includes football field and running track. At the same time, a Sports Center will be built near the Swimming and Diving Stadium in south of the city, with an indoor stadium that can contain 10000 people.

      <title>Man Spends 17 Years to Draw Map of Chaoshan</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/man-spends-17-years-to-draw-map-of-chaoshan.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yi Meizang, a 65-year old man from Xinan of Chenghai, has drawn a big map of the three cities in Chaoshan by himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yi loves poetry and earns his living by writing spring couplets for other people. In order to provide a reference to people who want to know about Chaoshan, he started to draw this map in 1989. Over the next 17 years, he bought many books about the culture of Chaoshan to study and went to more than 70 places to confirm that information he collected for this map. He reviewed the map five times and finally finished it in 2005. The map is about 2 square meters, including all the villages, hills, rivers, roads and bridges in Shantou, Chaozhou and Jieyang. There are also 10000 words of introduction of these cities’ histories in addition to the map. [according to an article from Shantou Special Zone Evening &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dahuawang.com/localnews/showlocal.asp?no=97584&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chaozhouren to Cycle around China</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chaozhouren-to-cycle-around-china.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mai Huang, a disabled boy from Chaozhou, is now cycling around the country in 220 days to promote the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, according to Shantou Daily &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dahuawang.com/strb/20071206/gb/strb%5E3049%5E4%5ESt060004.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mai was injured in his lower back at the age of sixteen. The injury affected the nerves in his legs. He was not able to run or jump again. He fell in love with cycling in 2004 and found hopes in his life in it. He started planning his journey early in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My dream is to cycle around China to promote the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games,” Mai said to the Shantou Daily five years after he was injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found two sponsors who provided him a bike and a tent. He also sought help through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 3rd 2007, Mai started from Shantou on his bicycle. He arrived in Guangzhou recently. According to his plan &lt;a href=&quot;http://maif19.blog.163.com/blog/static/56767391200711112505298/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, he will go to Sichuan through Hainan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chongqing and come back to Shantou in the first 130 days. Then he would head north through Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong and Hebei and Beijing. The whole journey is about 17000 kilometers long.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The New Spirit Film Festival will begin tomorrow at Shantou University and run through December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirteen independ films will be screened at the Science Lecture Hall starting from tomorrow, Tuesday Nov 27th. Three directors, two American and one Chinese, will be present to discuss their work and run workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese director is Zhang Jia Rui, whose work includes “When Ruoma Was Seventeen,” a film about the coming of age of Yunnan minority girl. (A rather poingnant synopsis is here at IMDB:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398388/&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398388/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American directors are Jay Craven and David Boyle. Craven is the son of well-known horror film director Wes Craven. Boyle’s film “Big Dreams Little Tokyo” might be described as “Napoleon Dynamite” meets “Lost in Translation.” Craven’s film “Disappearances” chronicles the adventures of a Vermont farmer turned bootleg whiskey runner and stars Kris Kristofferson.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earthwalker Stops in Shantou Enroute to Beijing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading an environmental and peace message, earthwalker Paul Coleman and his wife Konomi Kikuchi arrived in Shantou on November 9th from Hong Kong by foot, according to local newspaper Shantou Special Zone Evening. They planted ten trees at the Jinping Industrial Zone with officers from the Shantou Forestry Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started this journey from Hong Kong on September 22th, 2007. They plan to walk to Beijing on the eve of the 2008 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul said on his blog that his goal was to encourage the planting of 100,000,000 trees for people killed at war, and inspire other people to action for environmental preservation. He also said he had planted around 10,000,000 trees in at least 35 nations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Gov&quot;t English Website</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-govt-english-website.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know it may be hard to believe, but it does indeed appear that the local Shantou government has an official website in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find it here: www.shantou.gov.cn/en/main.asp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest I thought was the “Investment Project” link on the lefthand sidebar – it lays out a variety of different projects in the works or underway. (My favorite is “Robot Noopy for software learning.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the “Investment News” section doesn’t seem to have been updated in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chaoshan Airport under Construction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the People’s Daily, a Chaoshan airport project plan was passed on Oct 23, 2007, meaning that a new airport in Chaoshan will be built in the future. The recent Shantou Airport in the town of Waisha will be replaced after the new airport is built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chaoshan Airport is located in Jiedong county in Jieyang city, which is the center of Chaoshan. Jiedong is 20 kilometers away from the downtown of Shantou, Jieyang and Chaozhou. &lt;br /&gt;
According to the provincial newspaper Nanfang Daily, the government is planning to invest an about 3.8 billion RMB in this new airport and finish the project in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shantou Boy to Transport the Olympic Torch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After winning the championship of a student Wushu (martial arts) competition, sixteen year old Hong Jia Peng was selected to transport the Olympic torch on its stop in Shantou in 2008, according to the local newspaper Shantou Special Zone Evening (汕头特区晚报).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong is from Wushu training base of Shantou. He becomes one of the lucky citizens who will have the chance to transport the Olympic torch of the 2008 Olympic games in a ceremony held in Shantou on May 10th, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the local newspaper Shantou Metropolis (汕头都市报), transporting of the Olympic Flame from Olympia (Greece) to Beijing will begin in March 25th, 2008. The Olympic Flame will be transported around China’s 113 cities over 130 days after it arrives in China. Shantou becomes one of the four cities in Guangdong province, and the world’s thirtieth city to transport the Olympic torch. The other three cities in Guangdong are Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Huizhou. After the stop in Shantou, the Olympic Flame will be transported to southeast China’s Fujian provice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Farmers Open Family Libraries</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/farmers-open-family-libraries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Farmers in Haojing district opened the first family library in Shantou on October 9th, according to the Shantou Daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This library is located in Shangdian Villege on Haibin Street of Haojiang district. It has more than 2000 books and sixteen seats. As an infrastructure project built by the government, it will be run by the farmers themself to improve their knowledge of farming and help alleviate poverty, the Shantou Daily says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is planning to build 20 more these libraries as modelsby the end of the 2007. By 2010, the government hopes to build 342 family libraries. Nearly 40% of villages in this city would have their own libraries. These libraries are required to store at least 1000 books, 3 newspapers and 10 kinds of video disks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>English Journalism in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/english-journalism-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;…As in English-language, not England. Thanks to the Li Ka Shing foundation, Shantou University has engaged in a great deal of reform in the last few years. One of the schools that has changed a lot is the one I work for, the Cheung Kong journalism school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last spring, we were lucky enough to get Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize winner and former CCN correspondent, for a semester. But Peter became intrigued with China, and is staying on, at least through the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to working with great colleagues, I’ve been quite impressed with my students’ abilities at writing and reporting in English. It’s a tough and frustrating process for them, but some of the results are pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student of mine from Chaozhou recently wrote about her experience interning for the Guangzhou Daily’s Shantou branch office. I had planned on posting her article here, but it touched on “sensitive” issues, so I’ve posted it on my blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-bitter-melon.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Blogspot is blocked in China, so you’ll need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stupidcensorship.com&quot;&gt;proxy&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some really good stories on the Shantou J-school English website. Two of my favorites are “&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.stu.edu.cn/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=30&amp;amp;Itemid=29&quot;&gt;Crossing the Bay&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.stu.edu.cn/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=18&amp;amp;Itemid=29&quot;&gt;Tourism Will Save Us&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>桥溪村 Bridge Creek Village</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/qiao-xi-cun-bridge-creek-village.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About three to four hours northwest of Shantou lies a gorgeous mountain getaway that is like a little piece of Yunnan cut up and transplanted to northern Guangdong. If nature is your thing, Bridge Creek Village is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village is nestled at the back of a gorge about an hour outside of Meizhou. It is twenty minutes past a well-known tea plantation resort, Yan Nan Fei, Wild Goose Flying South tea plantation. While there are buses that run up that way, your best bet is to simply hire a taxi from the Meizhou bus station (80-100 RMB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village itself is full of old houses, many of which still have the faded slogans of the 1960s on the walls. But I was more interested in the natural surroundings. I took a long hike along the creek up into the mountains. A kind of stone trail winds through tea fields, and then into the forest and up the mountain.The nature is simply stunning, and once you are twenty minutes or so down the trail, people disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably six or seven guesthouses in the village, all fairly similar. Small rooms for about 100 RMB a night. Food choices are limited to the animals running around the yard and a bit expensive (25-30 RMB a dish) but good. We stayed at the last guest house on the right, as you walk toward the back of the village and the mountains. A nice place run by a nice family, but I strongly suggest NOT going during one of the major national holidays. At one point I counted 57 people and 19 cars in the driveway of the little guesthouse, which is probably suitable for about 15 people max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pretty good blog entry (in Chinese) on the village &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_49b59cbe010005qm.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attacked by Giant Spiders!</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/attacked-by-giant-spiders.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://myshantou.net/wp-content/spider-underside-markings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;spider-underside-markings.jpg&quot; /&gt;Okay, now that I have got your attention with the overly sensational headline, let me rephrase that. The hills behind the university are fairly scenic, and criss-crossed with trails nice for hiking. I have walked in them many times over the last three or four years. On no occassion however, have I ever seen what I did a few weeks ago: Dozens and dozens of very large spiders with enormous (three to four-foot) webs. While they are not attacking, it is no exaggeration to say the hills are literally overrun with spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the beast? It was tough to find out. But after some searching around, I have come to the conclusion that the spider is something called Nephila maculata, The Golden Orb Web spider, also referred to as the Golden Silk Orb weaver, and the Giant Wood spider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Florida with all kinds of creatures – snakes, alligators, plenty of insects – out and about regularly, so I feel pretty well-adjusted around critters. This spider, however, is kind of creepy. It is huge – I am 5’11” 180 pounds, and these spiders were bigger than my spread out hand. And lightning fast, I discovered when I got too close with the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pretty good webpage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/inverts/nephila.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that provides an overview of what this spider is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, it details the use of the spider’s silk in countries around Asia – the spider is found everywhere from Japan to the south Pacific.The spider’s silk, apparently, is incredibly strong – while I find this is a bit dubious, the page at one point compares it to Kevlar. One webpage I read said that in Japanese the spider is referred to as the “femme fatale” spider. Apt perhaps, as the big ones that we saw were mostly female, the male being nearly a fifth the size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting to me is how these spiders absolutely came to dominate this little habitat of the hills behind the school in just a couple of years. On our hike, my friends and I saw literally dozens of these things over the course of a mile or two. No birds to prey upon them? Actually, if I were any bird other than a condor, I would keep right on flying if I came face to face with one of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Plant and Flower Market</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-plant-and-flower-market.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shantou Plant and Flower Market is a pretty cool place – both literally and figuratively – to stop by and get a few green things to brighten up your apartment, if you are so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I was impressed that I could get five or six good-sized plants for about 120 kuai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these plants were unrecognizable to me, except for one which may be some variety of fern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market – Huamu Shichang, I believe, in Chinese – is off to the right of the last roundabout as you drive out toward the airport. It is on a long street that is called (please double check my Pinyin, this is from memory) Hengshan Lu. Actually, I’ve heard there is at least one more such market on this street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market itself is a huge outdoor space, the size of a football field at least. A rough, eyeball estimate would put the number of shops there at 30 or so. All selling, more or less, identical plants. This is a feature of business life here I find fascinating and really difficult to understand. You have got the street where people sell indentical-looking, identically-priced mattresses. You have got the street where all the artists are, selling paintings that are more or less the same as the paintings of their neighbor. You have got the plant and flower market. How do these businesses successfully compete against one another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you are not particulary interested in purchasing plants but need a cool respite from the hot weather, I would still recommend the market. Two thumbs up on being a relaxing place, where even shop owners have a mellow approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Home Away from Home</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/home-away-from-home.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming home can be weird. Especially when its to a place you know youll never quite understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Shantou for 3 years, from 2003 until 2006. Last year, I lived in Beijing. After a year there, I moved back to Shantou. As a foreigner, Beijing seemed a lot easier to comprehend – at least people speak Putonghua. But I never felt quite at ease there, the way I feel at ease in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to teach at Shantou University four years ago. In those four years, much has changed and much has stayed the same. Shantou traffic still seems to exist in a state of utter abandonment from order – motorbikes still scurry after pedestrians, even on the sidewalks. The dialect remains as nasal and impenetrable to me as it ever was. The summer sun and languid air are still hot enough to melt your skin and clothes into a soupy mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People havent changed much either. I see many of the old faces within a week or so of being back. There is my friend, local business titan and tiny, all of five feet tall in spike heel shoes, still taking over the city with her business ventures – and broken-hearted over the latest foreign boyfriend. There is the restaurant boss, fat and jolly and cooking up exquisite dishes for a dollar or two. There is the guy on his bike who scours the campus for plastic bottles and old shoes, working from morning to night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions with people are still full of emotional ups and downs; high ones when they are successful and low ones when they are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im out with my girlfriend and we find a second-hand store. The boss is in his mid-thirties, friendly, kind. He has a scar seemingly designed by Hollywood, running from his temple down the length of his jaw and neck, and continuing into his shirt collar. His toddler son is toddling about, intrigued by us. We manage to get a table and chairs for 70 kuai, which is probably too much, but seems dirt cheap to me after a summer in the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boss has a bicycle with a small engine and trailer hitched to it, and offers to take our goods up to school for 20 kuai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Id do it for free but that seat really hurts my ass,” he says with a grin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things get bad they get bad though. On another day, after walking around for hours not finding what were looking for, Ive had my fill of ‘hello’ and ‘laowai.’ When a group of tricycle drivers scream at me, I walk up to them and start going on in rapid-fire English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I dont understand, I dont understand,” says the main culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh you dont understand?” I say in Chinese. “But you just said ‘hello’ If you dont speak English, why say hello? Oh, I know –youre making fun of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that I smile broadly, give the guy the finger, and walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This succeeds at nothing, of course, except for upsetting my girlfriend, who is Chinese. I get a lecture on how theyre not really intending me harm, theyre just well aughing at me. I say that I understand that: I dont think they are bad people, but what they are doing is wrong. When in Rome, take what the Romans do to you until you cant anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One question,” I say. “Do you think those people, the ones who shout ‘hello’ to make fun of you, the ones who shout ‘laowai,’ ever think about how the person they are shouting at &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; when they do that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pause. “No,” she says quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the worst moments, the ones where you feel the gap unbridgeable. I wouldnt need to explain that in at least half the world, its totally unacceptable and fairly uncommon to publicly mock people for being different. She wouldnt need to feel she had to justify and defend peoples actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long before you notice all the things that have stayed the same in Shantou though, you see all that has changed. If theres one thing thats true, its that the local economy seems to be booming. Luxurious high rise apartments seem to be going up everywhere. There are at least three stores I come across selling imported wine; a few years ago, there were exactly none. The city – much like Beijing on a smaller scale – seems to be under construction and open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually, Ive never spent all that much time in the city of Shantou. Its really the university that feels like home. Despite the complaints of teachers and students alike, to me, Shantou U is one of the best places in China. It is quiet. There is space. The trees make caves of shade from the sun, and on clear days, the reservoir behind the school is filled with light. The whole place is ringed with small mountains that look like they are straight out of a traditional &lt;em&gt;shan shui&lt;/em&gt; painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its the beginning of another year, and the campus has started to fill with first year students. You see them trekking in, parents in tow, faces lit up. I can imagine how nervous theyre going to be when they sit in my class for the first time. It makes me smile. At the beginning of this past summer, I said goodbye to the first freshmen I had, from back in 2003. They graduated in July. Watching them go from petrified children to confident, educated adults was about as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its what makes it worth it to be here, in this place that will always and not quite ever feel like home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Ive deliberately done away with the apostrophe in this story, because the spacing issues are driving me nuts!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new look, a new start</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/new-template.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, how is Myshantou’s new look, like it? We have been using the old template since the beginning and it’s time to fresh up with a new one. I have spent my whole day twisting with it. Most of the work are done but there are still a bit more need to be done. I hope you will like the new template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the new look, there is another good news here to share! Since Maggie had left and I’m currently not in Shantou, I have been trying to find people that like this blog and willing to contribute to it. Lucky enough, I got to know &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-bitter-melon.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;ZhongYuan&lt;/a&gt; through Maggie. We have been in contact over a few emails and I think we are getting into a direction of continuing the blog. So don’t take us away from your bookmark, there will be more interesting posts of Shantou coming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I found a new blog which linked to us, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://ericsblog.org/ericsblog/&quot;&gt;Eric and Faye’s Blog&lt;/a&gt; - An American couple who just arrived Shantou and started to document their lives in Shantou and Shantou University. It’s aways good to read from others about the city. Well, that’s one of the reasons we started MyShantou.net anyway. Hope they will enjoy the stay in Shantou and good luck to both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! You all said you would help if you could! So come on, let’s see it - we have a request for information about hotels that cost 200rmb a night or less, in the central area of Shantou. I’m not in Shantou any more… any ideas? Need your help…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HappyLand English Club</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/happyland-english-club.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a comment in our blog a while ago from the one of organisers of a local English Club called “HappyLand”. I was quite interested and I replied in email and asked for more information about this club. Here is the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Happyland English Club,a nonprofit organization based in Shantou, founded on May 15, 2004, which was organized by English enthusiasts. Happyland English Club is aiming at creating a rich English talking environment for all English enthusiasts. “Practise in English and talk in English”. Through the efforts of all members, the club now holds activities weekly and has more than two hundred members from various industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://hi.baidu.com/sthappyland&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to attend one of their events when I’m back, if there is one by then. It’s a great way to bridge up foreigners and locals. From my personal experiences, the best way to make friends with local people in a foreign land is to start with those who are interested in your own culture. So I hung out with Chinese-learners or those who are interested in Chinese culture when I first went to the UK. Then I did the same when I went to Japan. It’s the best way to get started. So if want to explore the city and make local friends, maybe that’s the place to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou is safe from typhoon</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-is-safe-from-typhoon.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a few of my friends asked me here is my hometown ok from the recent typhoon. They must see the news in BBC or other media. I got a message from my Chinese mobile which sent by the China telecom in Shantou several days ago. They warned that there was going to be major attack to the city by the latest typhoon. I called my family the next day and my mum told me the typhoon changed the direction and moved toward Fujian province. Shantou was safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer there are at least several typhoons will come to or close to southern China. Shantou was one of the cities that in the potential damaging area. Last year Maggie wrote about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/typhoon-i.html&quot;&gt;typhoon I&lt;/a&gt; with some photos. That was pretty serious. I remember that it was also the first time we were contacted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; to get the first hand update about the typhoon. I wasn’t in Shantou at the time so wasn’t able to comment on that. However, in my growing years in Shantou, there were only a few serious ones that really damaged the city, the rest were just went past and didn’t cause much damage. However, it normally recovered quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully there is not more major typhoon this year! The climate changing is threatening now and we should really do doing something about it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantouren</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantouren.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My eight year old daughter was born in Shantou and then adopted to the United States when she was just a baby.   She is such an intelligent child, and started asking questions about her birth city when she was just three years old, wanting to know every detail possible.   As most people who google Shantou know, there isn’t a whole lot of information out there, so I was unable to answer a lot of her questions.   Finally, when my daughter was almost four, I decided to visit Shantou so I could learn as much as possible about the people and the city so that I could better answer her questions as she grew up.  I remember vividly sitting in the Hong Kong airport holding a ticket that said “Shantou” and knowing I was about to get on a plane to see my daughter’s hometown for the first time.   I was so excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight to Shantou was a short one, and from the airplane window I looked down and saw all of the farmland and green fields, and my heart started beating really hard because I realized that somewhere down on the ground were my daughter’s birthparents.   How I wish I could know who they were so I could tell them she is the most beautiful and amazing little girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming through the security gate in Shantou when we landed, I couldn’t stop laughing and smiling thinking I was FINALLY there, and I am sure the guard thought I had real problems since I was laughing out loud to myself.  And then I was actually standing outside, and I tried to memorize every detail so that I could tell my daughter, “I have been to your city and this is what it was like”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with Shantou on that first trip.  I loved the busy streets and the interesting lights in Time Square.  I loved all the red flowers by the park at the China Sea.   I loved the embroidery shops, and all of the street markets selling fruits and vegetables.   I especially loved hot pot and those famous Shantou beefballs!   I really enjoyed all of the Kung Fu tea I was served.  No matter which shop or store I went to, the tiny cups would be brought out and I would be invited to drink.  I loved watching the steps to make this tea and was glad I bought a teaset for my daughter so she could try this special tea as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so blessed to be able to visit the orphanage to meet the staff who had cared for my daughter, and I was also invited to visit a Shantou kindergarten.   We took a day trip to Queshi, and climbed all the way to the top and then watched in wonder as people strapped themselves to the cable line to head down the mountain. (we decided to walk down!)    Everywhere I looked there were red poinsettia plants, which in America only grow in pots during the Christmas holidays.   One of the most peaceful views we had was when we visited Shantou University and sat looking out at the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so difficult to say goodbye to the new friends I made in Shantou on that trip, but I returned home to my daughter with photos and gifts and lots and lots of stories about her birth city.  Anna is now SO PROUD to tell people she is from Shantou.   She can look at any map of China and immediately point to Shantou and say “that’s my hometown”.     I told her that I am so happy she is half American and half Shantouren, and she looked at me one day and said, “mom, I think you are half American and half Shantouren, too, since we are now family”.     I agree with her.   Shantou is forever in my heart, and I love meeting new people and discovering new things each time I return.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, my official goodbye! I’m now in Xiamen with my friends here… Will be here until August, when I’ll go to Ningxia to teach voluntarily for a month, then on to Qingdao to study Chinese for a semester :) It’s so exciting! All new. So much to do. So… goodbye Shantou… look after yourself…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Love Cat Organisation</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-love-cat-organisation.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.stcfa.org/bbs/images/logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Love Cat Org&quot; /&gt;One of our reader left a comment about giving away her two kittens. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.myshantou.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=19&quot;&gt;posted it&lt;/a&gt; in our forum and a member &lt;em&gt;stredsun&lt;/em&gt; posted a site call &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stcfa.org&quot;&gt;Shantou Love Cat Organisation （汕头爱猫协会）&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s great to have a organisation like that in Shantou. I don’t have cat or dog but I do have two birds in my family as pet. They are easier to be taken care of than cats and dogs. I remember it was once very strict about petting dogs in Shantou, about 10 years ago. You need to pay about 10,000 yuan to have a license to keep your dogs. But it’s very strict for keeping cats. Personally I think it was a bit too much at the time, but it certainly reduced the number of wandering cats and dogs on the street. People buy pets for presents, but just “throw” them away after realising all the troubles of keeping them, which I think it’s very cruel and unmoral!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are only staying for a short period of time in Shantou and want to adopt one, this site might be helpful. Or if you leaving Shantou and don’t want to leave your pets alone, find some kind owners for them!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An interesting advert</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/an-interesting-advert.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A funny advert on Youtube (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://istef.info/&quot;&gt;istel.info&lt;/a&gt;), but the man is speaking Chaoshan dialect!!! Even the fire fighters people shout in Chaoshan dialect. I wonder why this company named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centraalbeheer.nl/&quot;&gt;Centraal Behee&lt;/a&gt; in Apeldoorn use Chaoshan dialect in the ad but not Mandarin?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traffic in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/traffic-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a similar video when I was in Shantou and wanted to post it here, but I never did because 1) they are not as representative as this one, and 2) I was worrying whether it’s appropriate to post it here as it’s not a good image of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s the reality! I always sign about the terrible traffic in Shantou. It doesn’t seem to be improved through the years. It’s the first impression to travelers, so the chaos often shocked my foreign friends when I invited them to my hometown. Not all the roads are like that in Shantou though, but in general people just don’t follow the rules. I had a little bit “cultural shock” every time when I went back, my friends will laugh at me when I standing and wait for the traffic light for pedestrian to turn green to cross the road, because normally people don’t do that. In rush hour, following the rule may mean you can never get out of the queue of driving into a main road, because other drivers just won’t let you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the author of this video put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…There are no traffic lights or stop signs. Notice the school children on bicycles. I used to use the word “chaos” when I described the traffic in China. But I have finally realized it is not chaos. Regardless of the mode of travel - foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, car, or bus - that mode just becomes an extension of the person, and everyone moves in complete harmony. After spending six weeks in China, I have only seen one accident, and that was a rear-end fender bender on a major highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s quite amazing that the number of traffic accidents is not as much as people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder why this haven’t been changed for years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As stated in the previous post, Maggie is going to leave Shantou very soon. It’s a sad news for this blog as she has contributed a lot to this blog. As a friend and a co-founder, I would like to thank her for supporting and writing for us since this blog started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw there are some comments saying that this blog should continue. Yes, it will! Despite Maggie is leaving, I’m sure there will be some people like her who loves this city and would like to write about it. Also I will translate some news and write about some current news on the city. Although I’m currently not in Shantou, but I’m still very much concern its development and what’s happening there. If you are interested to join us and become a blogger of this blog, feel free to drop &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/qa/&quot;&gt;me an message&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the future of blog, I will spend sometime to organise the articles that we have so far and maybe make a archive page for our readers to search. If you have any ideas about further development of this blog and our community, or want to know about certain subject, do let me know as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a picture that I took with Maggie when I went back last winter. Thank you, 茉莉!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think now is a good point at which to formally announce that I shall be leaving Shantou at the end of July, and not coming back. Very probably not coming back. It’s been a nice three and a half years, but the world is big and I’m going to see it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, what’s going to happen to myshantou? There’s an awful lot of information on here. Does anyone have any suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou as one of the SEZs</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-as-one-of-the-sezs.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=4212&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about overseas Chinese business and offshore Chinese business network when searching some stuff for my exam. It might be less important now, but Shantou indeed was one of the first five Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that set up by Deng Xiaoping for economic reform experiment. And the main reason is described in that article as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 1980, when Deng Xiaoping began the process of opening China by setting up Special Economic Zones, free market enclaves on the southern border, he chose the ancestral homes of three of the most important groups of the Chinese diaspora: the Cantonese from Guangdong province, who predominate in Hong Kong; the Hokkienese from Fujian province, who make up 85 per cent of Taiwan’s population and much of Singapore’s; and, less well known, the Teochews from around Shantou, on the border between Guangdong and Fujian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teochews are a phenomenon. They include Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s most respected billionaire; the Ma family, which controls the Oriental Press Group there (and which fell out with the British Conservative party, accusing it of failing to deliver on promises made in return for campaign funding); and most of the Chinese in Thailand, including the Sophonpanich family who built up the Bangkok Bank. (The Lamsams of Thailand are Hakkas, a group of unknown geographic origin, which has produced the three most influential Chinese of the late 20th century-Deng Xiaoping, Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Teng-hui, the president of Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are about to travel to Shantou and want to know about the city, this might be something worth to explore into.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I’m on holiday in Singapore, and Richard suggested I should blog about it because a lot of our readers are actually in Singapore. I will sing nothing but praises for the country/city of Singapore, I’ve only been here 2 1/2 days so I won’t allow myself to make sweeping statements but… what an amazing place! How did it take me so long to get here?! Why doesn’t Everyone want to move here! Yeah. Fully approve of this country.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The &quot;Tong Yi Shou Ge&quot; Concert and Firework</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-tong-yi-shou-ge-concert-and-firework.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not much of a news anymore because the concert and firework were held on 25th and 26th of April. But I think it’s still worth to mention here as these two events were topical lately in Shantou. Even I know about it in UK, well, from my families and news on the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, these two majors events are the peeks of recent campaign launched by the government to attract investment in Shantou. As one of the special economic zones and had a high growth in early 1990s, Shantou was famous at the time. But start from late 1990s until now, the economy doesn’t go very well, or I should say the city doesn’t develop as well as it supposes to. There are many reasons for that, which I think might be too lengthy to write down here. However, lately, it seems to be some real actions to aim to revive the concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tong Yi Shou Ge Concert ( TYSG - 同一首歌)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TYSG is a concert held by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctv.com/program/tysg/01/index.shtml&quot;&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt;. They invite famous singers to the show and have been held in many major cities in China. It has been quite a lot of noises about why TYSG didn’t come to Shantou, because it’s kind of like a symbol for major city and Shantou should have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concert on 25th was mostly sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yihuagroup.com/&quot;&gt;Yihua Enterprise Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;, which I heard from my dad that it was a company in Chenghai but now grew to be a group corporate and got listed in stock. It went quite well overall, as the news &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.cn/search?q=%E5%90%8C%E4%B8%80%E9%A6%96%E6%AD%8C+site%3Awww.stnews.com.cn&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ezeem.com/forum/read.asp?id=1584&amp;amp;no=10443964&quot;&gt;critiques&lt;/a&gt; in some online forums as well. I can’t give any comment because I didn’t see it. But personally I am still happy to know the concert come to Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Firework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 160 thousands firework in the sky of Shantou and lasted for one hour on the 26th. It must be phenomenal, I wished I could be there. The firework was sponsored by Xinda GPS, which I don’t know exactly what it is but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gd.chinamobile.com/st/business/xdyw.html&quot;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; part of China Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sincerely happy to see any development, or even just some campaigns like that, in Shantou. The city is not doing as well as it suppose to, as I said. Hopefully efforts like that will bring Shantou a better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week in the life of Maggie</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/week-in-the-life-of-maggie.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite not being able to write about the following things, it has been an interesting and eventful week:&lt;br /&gt;
Two (unconnected) friends close to suicide (not so fun)&lt;br /&gt;
A fist fight&lt;br /&gt;
A crazy English school (not mine though!)&lt;br /&gt;
Great life changing news of one friend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately they are either about issues that we can’t talk about here, or stories that I shouldn’t, because the people are still around, and Shantou is small. Two of each! Leave you to guess which is which.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>International money transfer</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/international-money-transfer.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Also on a practical note, was dealing with a teacher in distress today (what a story!), which involved a trip to Western Union. Western Union is the most common way (apart from maybe bank transfer, Richard will be more familiar with these things than me) to transmit funds in and out of China. I have done it to the UK and to India, works well. Bank transfer takes 3-4 days, Western Union takes 1-2 hrs. Mostly only Philipinos and me send money out - the bank people say everyone recieves from mainly western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending from China to outside:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Take US dollars (good luck getting those!) and passport to Western Union point - I recommend the Agricultural Bank of China on Jinsha Dong Road, close to crossroads with Tianshan Road. They are extremely friendly, well-trained, and speak English. Don’t go to the post office. They are moody and unhelpful and no one lines up, very stressful. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are sensible and go to the bank I recommend, they will guide you through the form filling process and logging of money and things, and that is that. You will get a number which you should give to the reciever. You will need the sender’s home address and your home address, and the city to which you are sending the money to but nothing more exact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving in China (or anywhere really!) from outside:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Take passport, that special number, and the home addresses of you and the sender to any Western Union point in your city. In Shantou, recomend aforementioned bank. They’ll give you the money, don’t know if in dollars or rmb though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did discover today that you can transfer money from abroad into a local bank account, which is very simple to open, you just need 50rmb to put in it, and a passport. Then you give the bank name and address, which they have on little pieces of paper for you, and you tell your bank. I haven’t tried it but apparently it is very simple. It helps that these days bank workers are so wonderfully polite, Chinese manners at their best, and I love it. That is the future I think. Maybe they should privatise the post office.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clothes alteration</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/clothes-alteration.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to sing praises of the small things in life in this post. Namely that I can get people to mend and alter my clothes for me. I Can sew, should the need arise, but professionals do it so much better. Opposite my school in a little alley are two such shops, one of which now knows me quite well, because I get through buttons, zips and pocket seams like a small child. &lt;br /&gt;
Recently I ventured into letting them alter my clothes that were made for fatter people than me, the test was a success so I went crazy and handed over five more at once. Going to get them tomorrow, hope they haven’t cut them too small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could never do that in the UK. The joys of China. Makes my clothes last so much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why this site is in English</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/why-this-site-is-in-english.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of our readers, &lt;strong&gt;Jianfu45&lt;/strong&gt;, just left a comment that I think it’s worth to put it as a new post because it shows readers’ opinions about this blog. This is very encouraging when I heard from our visitors or readers. Thanks for your opinion, Mr. Jianfu45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Noted thanks. I read somewhere on comments by a” Little Bottle” about why this website in English. My answer follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nihao, To Little bottle and all here,&lt;br /&gt;
Firstly, this website in English is good for everyone as it will generate interest to look at opinion from whoever n wherever, locally included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those in China whose first medium is Putonghua and understand some English or more , this site can be an opener to see the language in its varied form used around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point (or for some reasons) .. many huachiao or people of Chinese origin or those with some blood connection,.. due to circumstances in the countries they grew up in and over generations, could not or did not learn to read or write Chinese. Some understand limited huayi but conversant in their Chinese dialects…some speak it but cannot read it and there are those who know parts of each and.. so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this site in English may reach and help these people one way or other, especially those who has roots in Shantou or thereabouts. They would be pleased to find this site if only to plan a trip or reading about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreigners who intend to visit China for business or tour would be just as happy to browse on this site to have a sample of what to expect of the region…..and in the end Shantou benefits too:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck and Kam Siah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Happy Easter!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Watching tv series, life is fun</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/watching-tv-series-life-is-fun.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would just like to point out that I appear to have run out of new things to do in Shantou. It is not laziness that has produced this lack of communication since New Year. I (and it is a trend that seems to be found in all the English speaking foreigners at present) have become boring, I like being at home and learning my piano and Mandarin, cooking for myself. Also I have rediscovered dvds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s something to write about. I don’t know where you can buy original dvds in the area - well, I do, Hong Kong, but that’s quite far, and anyway they cost 10rmb here and are great quality. Also I was introduced to bt - bittorrent, which is a great way to download tv series, now that friend has supplied me with suitable website. However it is in Chinese so not worth putting up here. Have to be careful though, my computer man said it will hurt my laptop if I do too much, I should really watch online. But computer downloads too slow for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, basically you can download anything that is shown on TVB Pearl, a Hong Kong tv channel. This includes but isn’t limited to: Lost, Desperate Housewives, Grey’s Anatomy, Six Feet Under (downloading series 4 right now!), Prison Break. Would like to find the Simpsons but I think the humour is difficult to translate for subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a final note, friend has pestered me recently to watch some of his West Wing series’ which I did and now I am hooked on that too. Yeah. These tv shows are a nice break. And I can understand why people think the States is so amazing to live in - if it were like in all these series, I’d want to live there too! Beautiful people, interesting lives, nice houses, a variety of food and bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS I also have all ten series of Friends, buyable at a store near you in Shantou for around 8rmb per dvd.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photoshop, good developing</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/photoshop-good-developing.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long time no speak, I am taking it easy and chilling out in my house a lot recently. But would like to point out a good photo processing shop - for digital prints, anyway. My friend was coming down and asked me to research out a good shop for processing - the shops in her city are pretty rubbish. I took a select 5 photos to four different shops, each photo having various mistakes in the picture quality. Then to see which shop altered the pictures the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we compared them, there were four of us present, and me and my (Canadian) friend both preferred the following shop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shimao Jiguang Photo Shop, address in Chinese - it’s down Jinsha Dong Road, on the block just past Diyicheng, on the right hand side (coming from centre of town).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;金砂东路中信世贸花园正门西侧A01铺面&lt;br /&gt;
Phone: 0754 8855828&lt;br /&gt;
Internet: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dinet.com.cn&quot;&gt;www.dinet.com.cn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, my two other (Chinese) friends both preferred the shop I’ve already written about, opposite Jinsha East bus station.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>INDOOR swimming pool!</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/indoor-swimming-pool.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well back in Shantou now, today I went and tried out the INDOOR swimming pool that I found just before New Year.  There is an indoor swimming pool at the Meritus but it is small and hot and costs 80rmb, so not for the general population then.  This one is at the Shantou Sports Academy (汕头体育学校), - oh, I hear you gasp and say you didn’t know Shantou had one of those, well neither did I but I was researching sports courses for another project and, well, came across it.  It is bam smack right in the centre of Shantou, on Changping Lu, but you would never guess because all the courts and tracks and things are hedged in with buildings.  There’s just a gate, and that’s written in Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 25m pool, heated (a bit, it’s a good temperature), which costs 20rmb a time.  This makes it more expensive than the outdoor pools (10 rmb a time), but still quite reasonable considering it’s inside and they pretty much have the monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You pay on your way out.  On your way in they hand you a lock, men’s lockers at one end, women’s at the other.  There is a small changing room with two cubicles and a lovely hot shower and also a toilet.  There is lots of mould high up on the walls in the changing room but it’s out of reach, which might be why it’s still there.  The walls are really high! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah and then you can swim - I advise people who can’t swim to wait until there’s courses coz when I went today there were no life guards around.  There were also only 6 people in the pool, all doing lengths, which was nice! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get a card, 30 times, to be used within 40 days.  I forgot to ask the price.  Address: 18 Changping Lu, Shantou 汕头，长平路18号，汕头体育学校  Telephone number of the instructor I met: 0754 8545855&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening hours to public: 8am-2.15pm, 7.30-9.30pm.  That’s def Mon-Fri, maybe the weekend too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mysterious Shantou International Airport</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-mysterious-shantou-international-airport.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from one of our readers a while ago asking is there going to be international airport in Shantou. Here is what he found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Shantou Waisha Airport, 13 kilometres away from city centre, was founded in 1956. It was estimated that at the peak period, near 2 million people, were transported through the airport. The major transportation from city centre to the airport is taxi. The taxi fee is around 20-30 RMB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Chaoshan International Airport, located in Jiedong Country which borders Shantou to the southeast, is under construction. It is expected to replace Waisha in 2008 and become Southeast China’s biggest airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have any information about this, so I posted it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.myshantou.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=8&amp;amp;page=1#Item_9&quot;&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;. And here are some from our contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Maggieee:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The airport in Shantou flies to Hong Kong, Bangkok and maybe Singapore, but it is more expensive than Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Xiamen. At present there is only one airport in Shantou. Its full name is Shantou Waisha International Airport. It is expensive because civilian flight rights are bought/rented from the millitary (who own the airport).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From stommywu:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The latest news from the Guangdong Airport Management Corporation, the company that currently managing the Airports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Shaoguan and Meixian. The new Chaoshan Int’l Airport is now under construction with a 2.6 billion RMB investment, and the name would be Tian E, as in English: Swan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About its size, its definitly not going to be the biggest airport in the southeast of China, I think the best guess would be half the size of the GZ Baiyun Int’l Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this airport being constructed are: first of all, according to Maggieee, its rented from the millitary and due to the managementship and the ownership issue, it creates a lot of problem which pulls the airport back from developing, in the 80’s, Shantou Airport was one of the top ten airport in China in terms of Passenger Volume, and as the other cities develop, the number starts to sink until now. Today even the Shantou people tent to use the Airport in Shenzhen, GUangzhou and Xiamen rather than their very own, so, here it goes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we can have some more information on this mysterious airport. If you know about it, feel free to leave some comments here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick notice. Maggie and I will be in the BBC “&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/default.stm&quot;&gt;Have you say&lt;/a&gt;” programme about &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?threadID=5533&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;edition=2&amp;amp;ttl=20070215180539&quot;&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardhong.com/2007/02/15/happy-chinese-new-year-at-bbc.html&quot;&gt;blogged this&lt;/a&gt; in my blog. It will be fun to watch it (or listen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the new year atmosphere out there in Shantou? There are a lot of things going on among postgraduate colleges here in Durham. Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shenshan Highway jams</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shenshan-highway-jams.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not impressed by the Shenshan Expressway (深汕高速公路), it is no longer very express.  It took me over 9 hours from Guangzhou to Shantou yesterday, where it usually takes 5 1/2.  It was crawling all the way down.  A tip for our transport managers: MAKE THE RAILWAY DIRECT, AND PUT MORE TRAINS ON.  Grr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to hear any excuses about it being nearly New Year.  In a few years it’ll be like that every day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Christmas at Maggie&quot;s 06</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/christmas-at-maggies-06.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just arrived back from England and am taking advantage of my jetlag to update my blog, instead of packing for my next trip… hm. Anyway, I am slightly shocked to see i haven’t written Anything about Christmas, which was by far my best yet in China. I had 6 friends round and cooked a full traditional English Christmas meal for them. It was quite an acheivement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to boast. For my first ever roast dinner (well, I made one when I was little with my mum), never mind Christmas dinner, I made: Christmas cake and pudding, mincepies, associated marzipan, icing, mincemeat and white sauce, roast turkey + bacon, roast potatoes, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, veg, and prawn cocktail for starter. In China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as a concession, I did have my workmate Steve (who was a chef in his previous life, and should be one now) to coordinate the cooking of the turkey, pots and veg on the day, because I didn’t know anything about the timing. My parents sent me recipies for Everything. Yen called his supplier for the turkey and bacon. Jess (who couldn’t come to the meal) supplied the icing sugar from Canada. I did however find that all special Christmas ingredients exist in Chinese medicine shops - cinnamon, nutmeg, almonds and the like. And the Chinese love dried fruit. I did everything not cooked on the day all by myself. So it worked out really well! And Walmart has just started selling the most excellent oven, to compliment my crappy one from Shenzhen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends, one English, one Singaporean and four Chinese, were a rainbow spectrum of enthusiastic, nervous, surprised and entertained. All were very brave, particularly Andy from the countryside just over the border in Fujian - he who does not eat even chips did very well with the raw lettuce and tried everything at least once!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twas a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say this the technical school my centre is part of, but as people are often looking for office workers versed in foreign trade regulations, this is the name and contact details of the lady in charge of placing appropriate students in companies that come looking.  I do not know if it is often successful or anything, but it is a service some people might find useful, and you could also try other technical schools (zhong zhuan), but I don’t know their names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou Foreign Language and Business Academy, Lin Lv Qun, Student Admin vice director.  Phone: 8173122  Website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stftas.com/&quot;&gt;www.stftas.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She speaks a few useful words of English but you will need a Chinese speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classical music concert</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/classical-music-concert.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it has happened now, I did write a draft on it then the draft disappeared - it was a draft coz the site wasn’t working properly in Shantou - I shall still post the notification, just so people know such events exist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On 27 January there was a concert of classical music, some Chinese, some western - played on combinations of piano and erhu.  I would’ve liked to go, because I am utterly starved of live music , but it was not possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took place in the Linbaixin Exhibition Centre, front seat tickets were 180/120rmb and back seat ticket were 80/50rmb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would’ve been nice!  My piano teacher told me about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese travel agents in UK</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chinese-travel-agents-in-uk.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a travel agent in Manchester that is also in Milton Keynes, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Paris, Beijing and Shanghai. They are a Chinese travel agent - I think Richard has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardhong.com/2006/10/26/flight-ticket-to-china.html&quot;&gt;talked about&lt;/a&gt; this type of travel agent on his own blog - but if you are travelling to China and NOT going to Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong, I really recommend you fly with them. They are set up so they can get you to cities in China for a reasonable price, ie £450 return, Manchester - Shantou, changing in Beijing. Now that is as it should be. They guarantee lowest fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omega &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omegatravel.ltd.uk/&quot;&gt;www.omegatravel.ltd.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Booking train tickets</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/booking-train-tickets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding transport in Shantou, particularly train tickets from Guangzhou, there are some nice people (no English though) just near where all the bars are that have a possibly somewhat illegal bus station - but also a very useful ticket office.  I have heard that people can’t buy train tickets for the big holiday periods but I have bought from there twice, once for National Day and once for just before Spring Fesitval, they only sell tickets from 6 days before departure but I have both times got the seat (bed) I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longhu Ying? Bus Station, Ying? Rd.  Phone:8367099&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appartently they can also book tickets from Xiamen train station but I’m sure they said that wasn’t possible last time I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS Don’t bother with the Shantou train station unless you’re going to Meizhou, which is the only stop quicker than the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Narita, Japanese restaurant</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/narita-japanese-restaurant.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never actually written about Narita, yet it is the most expensive Japanese restaurant in Shantou, and I hear Japanese people actually go to it, and so do a lot of ex-pats.  It’s also pretty nice food (it should be, for the price), not that I’m a conesseuir of Japanese or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I last went there with two Americans, they liked it and took their colleagues along, who also liked it.  I particularly recommend the beef curry, it is delicious, the sauce is what makes it so nice. If I go then I just buy that because I’m tight - 50rmb is enough on one meal.  I have been past times with other foreigners and they insisted on enough food and saki (Japanese baijiu/rice wine but easier to drink) to drive the cost up to 150rmb each.  You can choose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narita (cheng2 tian2), 2591183 is the phone no. to book tables and ask for directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to Di Yi Cheng, 18 Hengshan Rd, just past KFC.  That will usually get you there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beffet at Dihao Hotel</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/beffet-at-dihao-hotel.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One must-do thing whenever I go back to Shantou is to have a buffet lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regencyhotelshantou.com/&quot;&gt;Dihao (帝豪 - Regency) Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. It cost about 90 yuan per person for lunch, and 120 something for dinner (they may charge additional service fee). So I only go to lunch :) But if you go for dinner there will be more stuff and nicer food I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One piece of advice here: take their sushi and oyster. Normally I didn’t have main course but only eat their sushi and oyster, they are so nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share some pictures here. I want to go back again!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maggie&quot;s in England</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/maggies-in-england.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blimey! It’s easy to get on this website when you’re not in China, innit? We really need to find a half way house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just got to the UK this morning! It is ironic that I must come to England to sort out a blog about a city in China. Which I shall now do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview was fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Interview</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-interview.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally managed to convert the interview and upload it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest we were originally wanted to say about this blog, but after meeting us with us, they were very much impressive by Maggie’s Chinese and decided to move the angle to her. We didn’t want to lose such good PR opportunity, so we took it. However Maggie tried to talk more about the blog through the interview. After that she told me she was surprised that the media here could make the report the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for the TV people! Here is the video. The one below is in Tudou so it’s faster to view in China. If you are not in China, here is the view &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=937972676a5a1669b978d42648c28058.1750009&amp;amp;vback=Studio&amp;amp;vdone=http%3A%2F%2Fuk.video.yahoo.com%2Fvideo%2Fstudio%3Fei%3DUTF-8&quot;&gt;in Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; which might be quicker for you. But of course, you can also download it from here:&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Learning Chaoshanhua?</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/learning-chaoshanhua.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gabriel just posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/hello-again.html#comment-1512&quot;&gt;a comment&lt;/a&gt; on ‘Hello again!’ about a comprehensive Chaoshan dictionary. I have made several serious attempts to study Chaoshanhua, and in the last attempt actually made good progress, until I found I couldn’t satisfactorally split my language learning time between two languages so decided to learn to write Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stopped me the other times is that no one knows the tones of Chaoshanhua these days, they just speak it. What kept me going the last time is a book and tape set that I found in one of the Xinhua bookshops. There’s no point in me telling you which one, even if I could remember, because they won’t order anything in for you, you just have to go with what’s on the bookshelves at the time. But you can get them to check if they have it if you speak really nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be in the audio section. Chao zhou hua yi yue tong (潮州话一月通). Chaoshanhua, Mandarin and English. Forgotten the price. The units start off simple, unlike the vcd book I have, and the tones are pinned reasonably accurately - and the tapes let you hear them, so you can learn to differentiate, although friends can only tell you if you’re right or wrong, not How.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a Chaoshanhua dictionary! A student gave it to me when I told him I was learning. Chaoshan 18 Tone Dictionary. (Chaoshan shibayin zidian 潮汕十八音字典) 18 tones? Have I translated that wrong? It has about 8, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there are spaces under many of pinyin sounds - for the reader to add their own? It’s from Chaoshanhua to Mandarin. 30rmb.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A museum in Shantou!  Have a look!</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/a-museum-in-shantou-have-a-look.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally! A quiet evening and the internet is working too. Making the tv programme was fun, my main comment is how appalling my accent is, Really need to work on that. Today and the next two days all the schools are on exams, so there are hardly any students at tkd and no white belts at all. I’m going to start travelling at the end of the week! &lt;br /&gt;
I am going to do more research into this, but I have reports, one of which was published in June 05 in the US, that there is a museum in the Chaoshan countryside that is the only museum in China to be dedicated to that time around 40 yrs ago. It is officially recognised. It has no promotion, and apparently not even roadsigns! But it is sponsered by Li Kai Xin, and you can go and see it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pagoda Garden – – Museum &lt;br /&gt;
Pagoda Hill, Tucheng Village&lt;br /&gt;
Lianshang Town, Chenghai City&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the report, please e-mail me. Just putting out the tourist information…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS, Are there any other musuems in Shantou? I have never heard of any but would love to know if there were. However small.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The biggest online forum in Shantou - Ezeem</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-biggest-online-forum-in-shantou-ezeem.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ezeem.com/home/2005/ezeemlogo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Ezeem&quot; /&gt;The first time I got indicted into internet forum was when I got my ID in LinTao Teahouse – the biggest chatroom and BBS at the time. But now I guess &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ezeem.com/Forum/Default.asp?a=jl&quot;&gt;ezeem (e京)&lt;/a&gt; had taken over and became the biggest forum in Chaoshan area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its About page, it shows it has been running for at least 5 years. And they have a large number of registered users (I don’t know the exact number). It’s a pretty active forum. The section I like most is “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ezeem.com/Forum/forum.asp?id=1066&quot;&gt;Contribution to Shantou’s development (振兴汕头出谋献策)&lt;/a&gt;” . There are a lot of interesting posts about how to develop and contribute to this city, as well as discussing many social problems of Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum is in Chinese. So if you are oversea Shantounese and able to read Chinese, ezeem is a good place to see some up-to-date sides of Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello, again!</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/hello-again.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still, the most powerful media in Shantou is TV. We are lucky enough to get such a good PR from Shantou TV station. This can be proved by the number of emails I’ve received, comments in this blog, and dramatic increasing page view after the program about Maggie and MyShantou.net shown on TV tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So HELLO again to those who come here through the program. I guess the number will keep increasing from now on. Maggie and I are very happy to see more and more people reading this blog, as well as expecting more people to join in our conversation and helping us. I’m so grateful that quite a few people said they wanted to join us or have some photos wanted to share. Thank you very much. I’m keeping all your emails and let’s keep in touch. Meanwhile if want to contact us, here are our email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard: FRHong@Gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Maggie: Miggy.Ad@Gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or visit our forum: &lt;a href=&quot;http://Forum.myshantou.net&quot;&gt;Forum.myshantou.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum is actually a place for anyone to say anything about Shantou, so welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>114 information center</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/114-information-center.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number 114 used to be a inquiry number for phone number directory. Recently it had expended to an information calling center, you can now ask a lot more information like directions, restaurants and sightseeing recommendation in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a try last night. I called to ask about the rate to call the UK. They have both Mandarin and Chaoshan dialect services. It took a few minutes to process my questions, but that was pretty consider it’s quite a random question. However it’s a pity that they don’t (or not yet) have English services. So if you need any information while you are in Shantou, possibly you will need a local friend to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, there are two number which you can use to call abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) 96688 + national code (Cheaper)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Call to UK is 3.8yuan/minute daytime and 2.9yuan/minute off peak (8PM-6AM). Other nations may have different rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) 17909 + national code&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Call to UK is 3.6yuan/minute all the time, and it charges 0.2yuan IP fee per three minutes. For other nations the rate might be different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We are back &amp; On TV!</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/we-are-back-on-tv.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know the earthquake broke down the Internet for such a long time. If you read about the news (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationweek.com/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196801368&amp;amp;subSection=Global&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanguardngr.com/articles/2002/features/gsm/gsm208012007.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), you will know what happened. After I &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/earthquake.html&quot;&gt;wrote about the earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, the next day I started having difficulties accessing this blog, because it’s hosted in DreamHost which is in America. Anyway, the situation is getting better now and it’s said it will be fully recovered by 20th January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the recovery of the Internet, we’ve got another news here: &lt;strong&gt;MyShantou.net is going to be on TV!&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we attracted the interest of TV people and they had given us a special report on this blog. You will also see Maggie’s life in Shantou and a little bit interviews of us. The program is going to be showed on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday (10th Jan) 8:25PM at Shantou Channel 2 (汕头二套)&lt;/strong&gt;, and repeat on Thursday (11th Jan) 12PM also at Shantou Channel 2. Don’t miss that if you are in Shantou!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, Happy New Year to all the readers of this blog. Thanks for your support and participation. We will try to update more interesting stuff about Shantou and also hope to hear more from you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/earthquake.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A earthquake happened at 8:28pm tonight. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/topofthehour.aspx?StoryId=60589&quot;&gt;recorded as 6.7 and 7.2 around the sea near Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, but I felt it’s about level 4 or 5 in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My families were frightened, although Shantou is on the plate boundary, earthquake is rare. As far as I can remember, I experienced one in my fourth grade in primary school. But I hardly felt anything at that time. The one tonight was relatively strong, lights were shaking and we can feel it clearly even sitting on sofa. The first one came at 8:28pm, then another one followed about 10 minutes later. When the second one came many people started worrying and went out on the street. The phone line was unusable for about 10 minutes after the earthquake, mobile network was also busy and hardly had any connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TV didn’t give any up-to-date report on this earthquake, guess we need to wait until tomorrow to catch up with the “news”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lin Bai Xin Library</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/lin-bai-xin-library.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago when I was thinking to start this blog, I asked one of my Australian friends about his view of living in Shantou. He said a lot of things, but one of them was about the Lin Bai Xin library in Lin Bai Xin square. “It has been there for years but nobody wants to finish the construction and start using it”, he said. Indeed it had been under construction for many years now and nobody knows why. However last week it eventually opened to public and now we have another library in Shantou!&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/146/330578809_ff40583bf5_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Library&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went there yesterday to read for my dissertation. The building was brand new with nice facilities. They have computer rooms, several floors for different functions like reading and loan. I would give 9 out of 10 for it! They don’t charge for borrowing books but you have to pay deposits like 50 yuan for a year or something. But I wanted to use the reading room and it costs me 20 yuan a month (50 for three months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a little story while I was there yesterday actually. I went to the second floor at first. It is the loan section and I am not supposed to bring my own books in. But when I walked in the staffs there were having a nap on the desk so nobody asked me to deposit my books. Then after ten minutes, a few other mid age women went in and they started chatting about the weather, their son was late for school this morning, the lunch wasn’t that great etc. This is quite common in most public services, but consider that was in the library and people were reading, it was not acceptable. I couldn’t concentrate, after 20 minutes bearing, I went to them and tried to make a complaint. But I started by asking whether it’s business hour or lunch break, they said it was business hours. Then I asked was there the reading area, they told me it was loan section, not for reading. Fair enough, I didn’t go any further but asked them about where is quiet for reading. They pointed me to the fifth floor so I went. Still, I wasn’t totally happy about library staffs talking their own business loudly in business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I randomly found some good photos of Shantou again in Flickr. I’ve emailed the photographer and she agree to let me share them here. Very nice, I like them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zhuang (庄) living</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/zhuang-%E5%BA%84-living.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I must comment on how good some people are to me.  I moved house a few months ago to a zhuang (庄), which is like an estate - several blocks with the same name, hedged by main roads.  Each building in the zhuang has a number, if it’s a big zhuang and crosses several main roads, it’s split into north, south, east and west areas.  Zhuangs have reputations like all areas do, I live in the centre of Shantou so middle and upper class people surround me, it’s a good area.  Note: The majority of residents live in buildings with no lift, this is not an indicator of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love living in an estate.  There are trees on the road, people around all the time, and little shops everywhere for everything you could want, and they are the subject of this post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the little hardware store that sells me cables, lightbulbs, plug sockets, superglue, fixes my fibreoptic Christmas tree and broken fan.  They’re great, they don’t overcharge me and they don’t charge for service, only for the products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s a couple of chemists, I buy my Chinese and Western medicine from them, whatever problem I have I go in and describe, they tell me what to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over on the edge of the estate is a shop that opens out onto the street, she fixes my clothes for me.  Technically I could do it myself, but she does it so well, they don’t break, unlike my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also near the market is the shoemender who is also my bag mender, he sits on a stool outside all day every day mending shoes, nice bloke and thanks to him my shoes and bags last a lot longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then don’t forget the market and the Dazhong supermarket (大众超市), so very convenient and both cheaper/better food than Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I really like my zhuang.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou orphanage &amp; Love Without Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-orphanage-love-without-boundaries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I teach at Shantou orphanage once a week, the school-attending students, English - well it’s more like tutoring these days, but anyway.  The point is, Shantou orphanage is the recipient of quite a lot of help from an American foundation called Love Without Boundaries (爱心无国界基金会) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lovewithoutboundaries.com/&quot;&gt;www.lovewithoutboundaries.com&lt;/a&gt;, which was started after a lady called Amy came to adopt a child from here and felt strongly for the need to improve conditions for the children resident at the orphanage.  According to the bossman, she told them to get their stuff ready, she was going to go home and sort something out.  Bossman didn’t really take the promise seriously until two weeks later she phoned up saying she had money and surgeons and were they ready yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how accurate that it is but from what I can gather, it did start with providing medical treatment such as heart surgery, fixing cleft lips and sorting out limbs, and, well, word seemed to have got around and more and more orphanages asked for help in more and more areas of care and now they’re in (I think) several hundred orphanages throughout China, offering free medical treatment, improving material conditions in orphanages, and now organising foster care projects.  Non-Chinese staff of the foundation without exception work without salary (and some do it full time), I think in China they have about nine salaried staff, that’s of course not counting foster parents who come under the management of orphanages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m saying all this is because my students think Amy is absolutely wonderful and talk about her all the time.  So when they said she was coming this week I told them to let me know when so I could meet her too.  Then I thought Dr Huang, the head doctor in Shantou orphanage, might have a better idea of the exact time, which he did, in fact he asked if I wanted to go with him to the airport to be interpreter.  Which I did want, so I went, the bossman of the orphanage went too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she is really cool!  She feels really strongly about all orphans but has a special relationship with Shantou, I guess it’s where she started.  It’s fascinating work that’s being done, it really is.  The foundation wants to set up a centre for cleft lip children where they can be operated on (for free, naturally), and receive special care (many cleft lip babies get malnourished because they can’t eat properly) until they are strong enough to be fostered in preparation for adoption.  The centre would also be in or close to a rural area so that work can be started to tackle the myths that surround cleft babies in the countryside.  This together with the treatment available would hopefully mean that parents of cleft babies could be told about the centre before abandoning their child, send the child to have the necessary treatment and then be returned to them, to continue a normal life.  The idea is that there should eventually be one centre in every province, this way any cleft baby born in China could be sent for treatment as soon as possible.  Now that’s amazing.  They’re trying to decide now whether to have the first one in Shantou or in a place in Anhui.  I reckon they should do both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mon eve there was a dinner with the bossman of civil affairs, I’ve forgotten the right term, anyway it was at Xin Mei Yuan (新梅园) and the food was great.  Still, the stuff about Love Without Boundaries is the really interesting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick bus Shantou-Xiamen</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/quick-bus-shantou-xiamen.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another travel company recommendation.  I have yet to research this more widely, but there is a bus Shantou-Xiamen that gets there in 3hrs flat.  This is amazing, usually it takes 4, five if you get a crappy bus that circles Shantou for an hour before leaving.  It leaves at 3.20pm(ish) everyday from Jinsha Dong bus station. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company that provides this service is detailed below, with timetable.  I don’t know if the other times are just as quick, but the 3pm bus always takes three hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can however say that the return trip Xiamen-Shantou is nowhere near as good, they make up for being super-quick coming to Xiamen by stopping at every possible bus station, stop and layby that there is in Greater Xiamen, on the way back.  So the Xiamen-Shantou leg remains at 5hrs, 1hr circling Xiamen and 4 hours on the road, no way round it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave Shantou: 7.30, 8.20, 9.30, 10.30, 11.40, 13.20, 15.20, 16.40, 17.50, 19.30, 22.10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave Xiamen (Hubin bus station, ): 7.15, 8.15, 9.15, 10.15, 11.45, 13.15, 14.15, 15.15, 16.45, 19.45, 21.35&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Excellent &amp; honest travel agent</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/excellent-honest-travel-agent.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another recommendation due to great service I received.  GOES (Guangdong Overseas Education Services, 广东侨谊海外交流服务中心汕头分公司) is also a simple travel agent, well not that simple, it is one of the few places in Shantou that issues plane tickets, all the other travel agents come here to get theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend-of-a-friend is assistant general manager there, he’s called Chen Jun Li (陈君力), English name Alan Chen, and what a great guy he is.  So honest!  Which is unusual in local travel agents, I know from experience they are reluctant to sell you the best value tickets, what is that?  Do they get less commission or something?  He has helped me buy tickets for Yunnan, England and Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing was the most recent.  In the week after Spring Festival, when prices sky rocket, he found me a ticket Shenzhen-Beijing, 60% off, 1400rmb return.  That’s a really good deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend anyone to talk to him about plane tickets around and from China, he knows I’ve recommended him and his company to everyone reading this.  Contact number: 13929688708 (mob).  E-mail: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:stcjl_alan@163.com&quot;&gt;stcjl_alan@163.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Msn: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:stcts0754@hotmail.com&quot;&gt;stcts0754@hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.  I think he is more or less able to communicate in English, he knows it but not much chance to practice speaking, so speak slowly.  Writing I think no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://myshantou.net/chaozhou-embroidery-shop.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This namecard has been with me since 2005, just never got round to writing it up. If you want to earn money you should go to Shantou (preferably Chenghai) but if you want culture, go to Chaozhou, which has 1000 yrs of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaozhou has several special products, one being porcelain (瓷器), another being embroidery (刺绣). This is the address of a good embroidery shop that sells tablecloths and smaller things like handkerchiefs, and also bookmarks made of skeleton leaves, very pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breakfast in Shantou &amp; elderly English speakers</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/breakfast-in-shantou-elderly-english-speakers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am overflowing with things to write about. This morning I ate breakfast at my breakfast place, which is a little kitchen open to the street with tables outside. They serve xi fan (稀饭), which is rice cooked in an extreme excess of water so there’s lots left when the rice is ready to eat. An English name is ‘wet rice’. I really love the plate of stuff they give you for 3rmb, crunchy peanuts, pickled cabbage (酸菜), stewed egg, some little seafood thing, stewed bitter melon (苦瓜), inner organs of pig, pig fat. For an extra kuai (1rmb) you can have toufu skin or pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/166/390292842_04781e15bd_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/390293368_d6978af021_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;That’s one thing to write about, but today was special. I was inside coz it’s freezing outside and an old man was chilling out, ?a relative of the owners?, he commented to owners was I a teacher. I said yes I was, at which he said ‘Good morning teacher, how are you?’! He was into his eighties! Owners were equally entertained. He had a great accent. Said he’d learnt English in high school (高中).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject, this isn’t the first time I’ve met an elderly person producing English. I was in the middle of the Chaoshan countryside at a temple in the Chaoan area in 2005. That was the time I broke my foot and my parents had come to visit, so my friend Yen took them around the area including this place, the middle of nowhere and the temple is a 10-15min hike up a hill of steps. So I stayed at the bottom and made friends with the people selling things to sacrifice (mainly fruit and paper ‘money’). There was a really old man there who had been in the navy, and been all over, he kept producing random English words, it was great. It’s amazing where people have been and where they end up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Art shop, framing</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/art-shop-framing.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have several pieces of art that I’ve been planning to get framed for up to two years, and since I moved into my new flat they have been in a pile doing nothing. My friend suggested a shop. They sell art, but also frame stuff for you and come and hang it up, which is what they’ve been helping me do, so very cool! They don’t even charge to come and drill holes in my wall, not sure if that’s usual or special for me. Their shop is opposite Jinsha dong bus station (金沙东车站), on the ground floor of Jindu Yuan Building (金都园大厦).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also happen to know their nephew, who is a black belt at tkd, which just goes to show how small Shantou is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Animal hospital</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/animal-hospital.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a cat once, don’t know if I wrote about it, it was June just before Zhenzhu typhoon (the big one), I palmed it off on my friend Tammy coz the cat shelter was full and I didn’t want it.  However she took it on condition that I had it back when she left, so on her last day said cat, now called McChicken, arrived at my house, it was a bit crazy like strays are but settled down after a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after a few weeks she, because it is a she, started jowling really loudly, it became impossible to sleep, the noise woke everyone up within in hearing distance, several times a night.  My friend Yen researched a bit and declared she needed to be neutered or whatever female cats are, whatever, she needed the snip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snip she got, half a day early as we couldn’t take the horrible noise any more, also she kept lying prone at our feet, what a hore.  I don’t know whether I should recommend this vet to you.  He looked really scared, not worried but down right alarmed, at the prospect of snipping a female cat, stating repeated that the survival rate is not 100%.  No matter, just stop the jowling, be it snipping or death, we said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway McChicken survived although after a couple of days in the animal hospital the vet actually told us to take her back coz she was refusing to eat anything - they were the best days, when she was still weak and not annoying.  Then she got better and returned to normal.  Two weeks later I stuffed and selotaped her into a cardboard box again and took her over to have the stitches out, which she had infected, a couple of injections and 40rmb and I could take her home again, no need to return, as indeed there hasn’t been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/390294959_d663d22a51_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vet is on the corner of Jinhuan Rd (金环路), Zhongshan Rd (中山路) and Hengshan Rd (衡山路), that’s the side of Linbaixin Square (林百欣广场) near the sea, on the roundabout (yes, there’s a roundabout it’s easy to see).  It says PET HOSPITAL (宠物医院), in Chinese, in really big neon characters.  There’s another one round the corner that we didn’t investigate, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A real pet shop! &amp; Stray cats home</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/a-real-pet-shop-stray-cats-home.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the topic of animals, that very same week I came across another stray, and couldn’t very well leave it wandering around on its own, although the restaurant lads thought I should, so picked it up and took it to the place I’d seen in between the two vets which claimed to take in waifs and strays 24/7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/390293978_154110fab6_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pet shop!  A real one!  Not just selling cats and dogs!  In fact cats and dogs were the side business!  They sell, most importantly to me, Russian hamsters and all necessary hamster caring-for equipment such as SAWDUST, how long have I looked for that, but also rabbits, snakes, scorpions, various other lizards, and a variety of turtles.  And, they are connected to or based on, not sure which, the charity in Shantou that takes in stray cats, of which there are a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/390296695_90a4658536_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/89/390297162_7edc75392d_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I produced the kitten they promptly stuck her in a cage with a mother who already had her own kittens and two other strays, saying as long as she didn’t hit it then stray was stray no more.  Mother cat didn’t hit the stray, so I can only guess it got taken to the big cat centre when it was old enough because they’d all gone last time I visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard about this cat centre before.  If you take a cat there you have to pay 30rmb a month until it gets adopted, which really does happen.  I think that’s a good way to run a centre, although I don’t know how they guarantee the 30rmb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the post about the animal hospital to find the address.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Hong Kong to Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/from-hong-kong-to-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There were a few questions about how to fly to Shantou from abroad. There is no international airport in Shantou, the closest two are in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. I haven’t fly through the one in Guangzhou before, but maybe worthwhile to mention the way to travel from Hong Kong international airport to Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many routes of airport bus in Hong Kong, they take you to any port of the city. The one I took most is to Sha Tin (沙田). Then there are two ways to go from Sha Tin to Shantou:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Change in Shenzhen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a tube from Sha Tin station to Lo Wu (罗湖), where is the custom between mainland China and Hong Kong. Be aware that it’s extremely busy in Lo Wu usually, so it’s better not to go in rush hour or weekend. After exiting the custom you will see Lo Wu station, just ask the staff there which one can take directly to Shantou. It would be much easier if you can read Chinese, because most route are written on the coaches. However, still need to ask to confirm. One more piece of advices - be careful with your personal belongings because Lo Wu is also famous for its poor security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes about an hour from Hong Kong city centre to Lo Wu station, then 5~6 hours from Lo Wu to Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are changing in Shengzhen to Shantou from Hong Kong, you don’t have to go through Sha Tin station. From any underground station can let you travel to Lo Wu. I go from Sha Tin is because I usually stay in my friend whose house is in Sha Tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Direct coach from HK to Shantou&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I did this time. There are several companies that provides direct coach from Hong Kong to Shantou, the most well-known one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regencyhotelshantou.com/&quot;&gt;Shantou Di Hao Hotel (帝豪酒店)&lt;/a&gt;. They provide coach from both HK to Shantou and Shantou to HK, the price is about 150 HKD. You can call them (0086-754-8800029 or 0086-754-8800037) to book tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s direct coach, but you have to get off when go though custom. It normally takes about 5~6 hours to travel as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all I know. I will update if I got more specific information in future. Or if you’ve got some suggestions, feel free to leave a comment here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments from this article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Lim, on December 9th, 2008 at 3:56 pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is this service call SkyLimo that can take you directly from HK Airport to Luo Wu but is not cheap. They quote me HK$1300 - HK$1500 by two different operators. This a non stop 7 seated MPV (Toyota Alpha) that can take 7 persons. You clear both China and HK immigration without get out of the car - a direct point to point service. My understand is such service is also available in anywhere in HK for only HK$1000. I use this service and pay HK$1000 on the way back to HK. It is the most comfortable mode of travelling between ShengZheng and HK, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t use this service to travel from HK airport to Luo Wu as it is too costly, Instead I book two taxis (HK$280 each) to bring me to the nearest MTR station before Luo Wu and transfer to train. The rest of the jounery is same as those who take the train.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rain in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/rain-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://aycu10.webshots.com/image/6209/2005941234069714569_rs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rain&quot; /&gt;Another sleepless night for me because of jetlag. But thanks to that, I have been listening to the rain outside ALL NIGHT LONG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain in Shantou is different to the rain I know in England. UK is famous for its rain, which can be easily described as “300 out of 365 days in a year is rainy”. But the rain in UK is not as consistent as in Shantou, it’s more like rain for about 10 minutes, then stop, then rain again for another 15 minutes, stop, and again…. Sometimes rainy weather like this can last for weeks without having one sunshine day. Whereas in Shantou, it can rain for one whole day without even stop for one minute. However once it finished, sunshine and nice weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter is not a rainy reason in Shantou, so what I am having outside now is rare. Maybe it’s because it needs some rain to bring the temperature down to be like winter. Seriously, it still amazes me that the temperature can get to 20 something in mid-December. But when it comes to summer, rain is a small case, typhoon is more likely to be the main concern. Maggie wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/index.php?s=typhoon&quot;&gt;some huge typhoons&lt;/a&gt; this summer, that’s what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to good weather because I want to go out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I am back to Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/i-am-back-to-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to be back home. I just arrived in Shantou this morning from Hong Kong. I will be staying for one month until 14th of January. While I’m here, I will try to keep myself updating this blog on daily bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First note today, it surprises me a lot that the temperature is around 22C here. When I left England three days ago it was around 1~5C there, and now I’m like having a English summer again in the middle of December, amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still in my jetlag now and better catch some sleep now. Hopefully some interesting posts will start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New server and forum</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/new-server-and-forum.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m please to announce two big changes of MyShantou.net - 1. we are moved to a new server and 2. we have our own forum now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just moved from a Chinese hosting company to Dreamhost. This means we can use all the features of Wordpress and enjoy a more stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure the loading speed in China, but if you are outside China and visiting our blog, I am sure you can feel how much faster compare to a few days ago before moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Forum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have our own forum (&lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.myshantou.net&quot;&gt;Forum.MyShantou.net&lt;/a&gt;), yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maggie and I didn’t expect the number of visitor and reader at the beginning when we started this blog. It’s exciting to receive comments and question about Shantou from time to time, and we have tried to answer as much as we know. However, only two of us is impossible to answer all the questions this dynamic city. So it’s better to have a place where everyone can join together and share what you know about Shantou. Knowledge come from sharing, as I always believe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to see a lot interesting conversations going on there, so feel free to post whatever you want to talk about or questions you want to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&quot;s been a while</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/its-been-a-while.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking I should just mention that I’m still here - I was on holiday in Yunnan for a week with my parents and they were in Shantou the week before that, but we didn’t go anywhere new, mainly just to my friends’ houses to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yunnan was excellent, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back in Shantou and rushed off my feet, have a nice evening off now (from tkd) coz went to a friend’s wedding - in Meizhou, so also not applicable to this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the only thing I can think of to say is that Chinese cooking is going well for me these days, the key is to NOT be fussy.  Generally this means putting garlic in a wok then assorted meat and veg, or boiling water and adding oil and chicken stock, then assorted meat and veg, and noodles.  Shellfish are the easiest of the lot.  And, it all tastes great.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sunglow Filipino band left :-(</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/sunglow-filipino-band-left.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, call me starved of good live music, but on Friday night at Sunglow I discovered a very listenable Fillipino band* has been playing there nightly for the last couple of months, and it was lovely to hear live music that I know and quite like, from the traditional set of guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, male and female vocalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked it, we haven’t had a decent live band in Shantou since the last good Sunglow Fillipino band left about the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And off me and Tammy went this evening to listen to them again, and what’s happened?  They’ve done a runner.  What’s that about?????  They played last night (Sat) and then according to all the waiters, they’ve gone forever.  There was just nothing playing during their set time tonight so it must have been some kind of bust up.  I assume it’s because the owner hasn’t been treating them well, like usual.  Dammit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, good luck to them, hope they meet a nicer boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*There are Filipino bands in every big city in Asia, I think, they are cover bands of widely varying quality, generally pop music in a variety of languages, particularly English.  Some are pretty good and some are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS Party was ok.  Now no decent Filipino band, Sunglow ranked back down as average pub/bar place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know it’s a bit late to broadcast it to the world but it seems to be a big event in the expat community, people keep texting and e-mailing me - there’s a party at Sunglow tonight.  Don’t know what the fuss is about, going to have a look.  I think a lot of foreigners are…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Tkd Tournament Sep 06</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-tkd-tournament-sep-06.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tkd tournament on Sunday 17th!  In Shantou, Dongxia Sportsground, Baihua Rd.  新力量跆拳道，东夏运动场，百花路  Morning and aft.  I’m an umpire, which stresses me out slightly as was presented with the rules and requirements on Monday and after spending one afternoon being taught the basics moves, two afternoons at the tkd place (道管) with the wonderful Kit (小猫) helping me read the rules and reqs, and one afternoon mocking fighting and fouling, I still don’t think quick enough to look like I know what I’m doing when I judge whether it’s a warning or a right out foul.  Arghhh&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Wendy Chen, on the birth of her first baby! Born at 8斤（1斤=0.5kg）, I’m not surprised she was enormous the week before he was born. A boy, Jay wants to call it Kool…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My hamster</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/my-hamster.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/91/239166520_3a512cd70c_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Well in case anyone has ever wondered, you can buy hamsters in Shantou. This is mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You buy them, along with guineapigs, rabbits, a variety of birds and many, many goldfish, on the road at the base of Walking Street (步行街). They cost 15-20rmb and they’ll charge you for the cage which is impossible to make the poor thing live in. The vendors work on the side of the street, and you buy the feed from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a pair of Russian ones back in my first winter here but they both died within a week (one drowned in the water bowl and the other either died of a broken heart or the cold). After returning from a trip to Hong Kong (to see my bro off) with a hamster cage, water bottle etc, only to find the remaining hamster dead, I couldn’t bring myself to buy another for another two years. But in May I took the plunge and it’s not dead yet although I desperately need to go buy more food before it starves - do hamsters starve if they live on green veg and carrots?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who loves dogs and cats, dogs are expensive and pedigree, being a staus symbol (we have money to waste on an animal!), although you don’t need a license any more. Well-bred cats can also be bought, or you can steal one from the street cats, or there’s a cat shelter (has been mentioned before) or really any small shop with a cat outside will sell you it or tell you their friend’s phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love neither dogs nor cats, I love hamsters, so I have a hamster, and intend to get it through the winter alive. I’m sure I’ll tell you if it dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There are petshops for cats and dogs or you can buy them from near Walking Street too.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chaoshan Snacks</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chaoshan-snacks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey so we got our new teachers (nearly lost one, but he was bright enough to make his own way into town). Last week we took them for a quick tour of town, and went to a pretty famous Chaoshan snacks place, photos beneath. The main thing to remember is that it looks like fat but it’s NOT, it’s rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Address: 金凤坛再过去一点 Jinfengtan, a bit past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snacks we ate: haoguew豪果，五果汤，无米果&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/97/239166378_ff6ccefa11_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kejia food 客家菜</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/kejia-food-%E5%AE%A2%E5%AE%B6%E8%8F%9C.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just went to a pretty good restaurant, it’s 客家 (Ke4 jia1) food - I think that’s Hakka in English. A lot of the food isn’t actually Kejia, but the stuff that is got the approval of my tai chi teacher friend, and he speaks their language (Kejia hua).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s next-door-but-three to Haley Cafe of the corner of Jinsha Dong Rd and Huashan Nan Rd. It’s pretty small - there’s an Ouyji (or whatever the spelling) nearby and and hairdressers next to Haley Cafe. A kids games arcade is opposite, as is an academy with basketball courts. The shop is red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can eat full for min 6rmb (see the back page of the menu) - dishes cost around 15rmb each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know: Kejia, Chaoshan and Minnan huas are three dialects belonging to three distinct cultural groups in the east of Guangdong and south of Fujian. They are particularly noted because they have withstood the influence of most national changes to the language and culture and bear a reasonable resemblence to ancient Chinese (so I’m told, it’s also been written on this blog in the comments). Chaoshan and Minnan hua are similar, while Kejia hua more resembles Cantonese. The home of Kejia culture is Meizhou, a three hour bus ride or train ride from Shantou. The Rough Guide is very favourable about the area, which makes a nice change from Lonely Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>澳头海鲜 Outou seafood</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/outou-seafood.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel I should say hi just coz it’s been so long since writing something. It’s the summer holidays, which means everyone that offers any kind of classes if offering overtime, and anyone who doesn’t have to work is going to classes, and sometimes if they work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… I’m busy - and the internet has been down for a week and a half at school (grr). Daytime English, nighttime tkd and also I have a life to keep up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm… Went for seafood last Sunday. Outou 澳头 (ao4 tou2). It’s in a place just outside Shantou called Dahao 达壕 (da2 hao2), which is really the countryside - swimming, hills, fresh air. Unfortunately you need a car, but the seafood is excellent. In Dahao there’s a place called Outou, which has a row of seafood restaurants. I always get taken to the same one, the one at the end of the row - don’t let those lads standing in the middle of the row steer you in to park, they just want you to eat at theirs (which could well be good, who knows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, my friend sure ordered a lot. A wide selection of shellfish that you scrape/suck/pick out of shells, snails, crab - raw and fried, green veg, several Chaoshan snacks, a couple of fish and don’t forget the soup. All for 9 people. Delicious. She said it wasn’t very well cooked, but it was good enough for me. And not a sign of bad stomach - very fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry I’m rubbish at directions on roads. Ask a local, or even better take someone who knows with you. 澳头.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following pictures were taken by my friend’s daughters (who also count as friends!), taken together you can get an idea of the place where you order… food wasn’t their aim in these photos…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meeting Shantounese in Oxford</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/meeting-shantounese-in-oxford.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a mid-age Chinese lady working in my restaurant. I saw her on my first day at work but didn’t talk to her until last week. After a little greeting, she asked me where am I from in China, I said Shantou, then she went on and asked the name of the road near my house. I was a bit surprised but then she told me her husband is also from Shantou and she go there almost every year. Her family is living in Oxford now and her husband is working at the Chinese medicine shop in city center. I was so excited when I heard that, because it’s very rare to meet people from my hometown abroad. I know a few friends from Shantou and studying in UK now, but I have never meet Shantounese randomly like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after work, I went to her husband’s shop right away. While I was living in Oxford three years ago, I walked past that shop many times but I had never thought the doctor inside is just from my hometown, how weird is that! I remember I even spoke to him once when I tried to ask for a part-time job, but that was in Mandarin so I couldn’t tell he is Shantounese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he was very friendly. His wife already introduced me to him before and went, so he talked to me in Shantou dialect straight away. It’s so strange to speak Shantou dialect outside Shantou. For those who don’t know about Shantou dialect, it’s a language that completely different to Mandarin or Cantonese. It’s kind of similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian&quot;&gt;Fukien&lt;/a&gt;, but still a lot differences. In short, it’s one of the Chinese dialects but only people from Shantou area could understand. I only speak to my parents in our weekly phone call or when I went home, other than I haven’t got a chance to use it at all. That’s why I felt so strange. And he, I should call him Dr. He (not English “he”, it’s Chinese family name “He”), was like me. Since he has been living in England for many years, it’s harder for him to speak Shantou dialect. However, we still tried to speak even though it would be way easier if just speak Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of us were very happy to meet each other on that day, and a few days ago he introduced another Shantou student Ke to me. Ke is currently doing a MA in Oxford Brookes University and also the vice-president of Chinese student community in Oxford. He is an excel and smart guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a cultural sense that people from Shantou (or say Chaoshan area) are very united when they are abroad. There are a lot of stories about Shantou people united together and achieve great success in their overseas lives. Live examples would be those successful businessmen in South East Asia countries like Singapore or Thailand, most of the richest people there are originally from Shantou area. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Ka_shing&quot;&gt;Li Ka Shing&lt;/a&gt;, wealthiest person in Hong Kong and East Asia, is Shantounese too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pound of being a shantounese, and wish I could be one of those successful ones in future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou eye hospital and inner heat</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-eye-hospital-and-inner-heat.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a Chinese medicine friend looked at my tongue and checked my pulse, looked worried and warned me my inner heat (内气) was unusually high.  He did it twice and both times he preceeded by a couple of days infections worthy of hospital attention, unheard of for me in China.  This week it’s my left eye, which went blind on Sunday, not really a nice experience, also it really hurts.  I did, however, go to bed at 9pm because there was nothing else I could do.  With the help of painkillers I got nearly 10hrs sleep and was still up bright and early (earlier than when I have to work!) at 7.10am and getting ready to go see the eye doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so much sleep and so long with my eye closed, it was actually a lot better - hooray for the body’s natural immune system - but a trip to the eye hospital still necessitated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eye hospital (眼科医院) is attached to Li Jia Cheng’s (李嘉诚) research hospital way up one end of Dongxia Lu (东厦路), and is funded mainly by him and a Hong Kong uni.  I like this hospital!  Clean, modern, nurses - polite ones -  keeping everyone in line, short queues, clear instructions about where to go next.  Ahh, it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opitician did prescribe me some extremely expensive medicine which in my unmedical opinion may have been a bit over the top, but hey.  My eye’s much better.  I think I’m going to buy some of the herbs my friend advised me to get though, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to cooking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese cooking has been somewhat of a mystery to me since I arrived in Shantou, a mystery I have dearly wanted to crack, but just couldn’t get my head around.  My friend’s parents, and my friends with kids, their food is so delicious yet so cheap, how on earth do they do it?  Do I have to give birth first before I can know how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been making progress on this issue, fuelled by the willingness of a family I’ve come to know to invite me to their house and let me watch whoever’s cooking and ask small but annoying-in-large-quantity questions like ‘what’s that sauce?’ ‘so you put them in together then?’ ‘what’s that? where do I buy it? how do I ask them to prepare it?’ (Market sellers often prepare meat seafood and veg to your whim, no wonder cooking’s so quick, everything’s already gutted, skinned, sliced, shelled, peeled and had the ends chopped off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I thought, I should share this wisdom with English speakers who aren’t blessed with Chinese parents.  So…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fragrant potato rice, Fishball and jiugua soup</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/fragrant-potato-rice-fishball-and-jiugua-soup.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fragrant potato rice:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice, a potato, couple handfulls mo2gu1(dried mushrooms), some beef, some pork, lots spring onions, couple tablespoons oyster sauce. (Quantities: how much rice and meat do you want to eat in a meal?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut the potato up and fry it in oil for a couple of minutes until starting to go golden/burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the potato in the rice pot/cooker with rice and water (water2:rice:1), and start.  If don’t have rice cooker (either very poor or not in Asia) bring rice to boil with lid on, then turn down to lowest heat - don’t remove lid.  Keep on low heat until no water left.  Secret of rice :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEANWHILE: Stirfry meat in oil.  Then stirfry meat, oyster sauce, chopped spring onions and mogu.  When rice is cooked, add in and stirfry for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice tastes of fried potato, delicious - even if you’re not keen on potato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Fish ball and jiugua soup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A jiu1gua1 (kind of veg melon), some fish balls, water, salt, chicken stock, oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring water to boil with some salt, chicken stock and oil mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When boiling, add the jiugua and the fish balls.  Boil on a lower heat until the jiugua isn’t raw, and the fish balls are a bit bigger.  It doesn’t take long - 5 t0 7 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can eat both dishes later that day, or the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good dimsum places</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/good-dimsum-places.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of decent dimsum places in Shantou, even though it isn’t a local speciality.  There are two that I know of, and both are restaurants in expensive hotels.  The first is - I’ve forgotten the English name - 海景酒店 on Haibin Road (海滨路)near the ferry.  The second is in the Meritus, Jinsha Road East (君华酒店，金沙东路) on the second floor.  I imagine both are expensive but I’ve never had to pay for meals at either place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like dimsum and anything you can nibble at generally, it’s one reason why Chinese food suits me so well.  Although dimsum here isn’t quite the same as in Shenzhen, Guangzhou or Hong Kong, to my relatively uneducated tongue it’s very good meal.  And the congee I get given is always delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who really miss dimsum.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Screeching insects</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/screeching-insects.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to take a picture of one of the little creatures that live on the trees at this time of year, if I can. They’re like cockroaches but they live in trees and they’re bark colour and don’t crawl/fly into your house. So I don’t mind them. But they’re VERY noisy. They make this kind of screeching sound - a bit like a thousand crickets gone crazy - possibly there are actually thousands of them in each tree, which is why they’re so loud.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Air raid sirens tested</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/air-raid-sirens-tested.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Air raid sirens got tested on Wednesday! Apparently it was in the paper, which I didn’t read. It’s a bit spooky hearing them in real life. They test them every year. Makes me wonder why they need to keep them working… I was in class at the time and asked where we should go anyway, if we heard them. After pointing out that we would be clearly warned of imminent war by the media some time before the event (true), they said there were ‘holes in the ground’ for everyone to go into. In People’s Square (人民广场), for you who live in Shantou. I said ‘what, the entire city?’ They were a bit vague about that - but there was something about people setting up guotiao (local noodle type) stalls in them now, as they were otherwise empty. So at least we won’t go hungry if we get bombed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fruit drinks</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/fruit-drinks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After bbq we head straight on for freshly squeezed fruit juice on Zhongshan Lu, also pretty famous due to its quality.  The fruit juices around Walmart are very average, but the this was good stuff.  Sorry, I can’t pinpoint it, it was just shops nearby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mango was veeery strong sweet mango taste, mmm, the papaya and the pineapple that my friends had were also excellent - I don’t usually like pineapple but the taste was just right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know: you can go to stalls that have whole fruit on them and ask them to squeeze it, add ice and stuff, and make a hopefully delicious iced fruit drink of your choice.  They cost 2-4rmb a drink.  They’re delicious.  Some people make better drinks than others.  Mango is always a good bet, watermelon is popular, papaya, pineapple, banana, tomato, carrot, apple, orange, dragon fruit, other kinds of melons (even bitter melon!), lemon… generally lots and lots.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BBq</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/bbq.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rain has stopped so we took the chance and went to Shantou’s most famous bbq, which is just the next block along Waima Road (外马路) from the Catholic church.  It’s open from 10pm to 3am.  It’s the longest bbq I’ve ever seen, and at weekends absolutely packed, you might have to stand until seats become available.  Next door are two more bbqs with no business at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bbq is especially famous for its chicken wings and dried tofu, both of which were delicious, it also have some veg.  As with most famous food places here, the menu is limited, but people come from far and wide to taste it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner is called Asa (I only know the pinyin), be careful other people have stolen his name, but he’s the only genuine one, every night, in that place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you eat a lot it’s not cheap - 4 chicken wings, 2 pieces of tofu, a squid, some fish, a bottle of water and some veg cost 25rmb.  Mmm it was worth it though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hospital visit</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/hospital-visit.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it’s still raining, it’s June and I haven’t been swimming yet. Humph. Have I been anywhere interesting lately? No… really busy at school and tkd, and also it keeps raining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have a trip to the hospital last week. Any British people, don’t EVER moan about the nhs. Or, only moan to keep the politicians on their toes. Actually, it’s an amazing, fantastic, wonderful, attentive, comprehensive, unjudging service, I thank God quite frequently that if I ever got seriously ill I could go back to the UK and get treatment until I got better, not until I ran out of money. The nhs, what a fantastic idea, people should look after it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh those of you who aren’t British - our healthcare if free to all citizens, and emergency healthcare is free to anyone who happens to be there (from what I can gather). Free! Now, you might have to wait a long time if you’re not going to die, but hey, if you’re going to die - they’ll do their best not to let it happen! How cool is that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have become quite cynical about the big hospitals in Shantou. From what I can find out, if you’re poor you get free education, but not free healthcare. They will let you die, and they will turn you out if you can’t pay for the bed. I don’t know what happens if you’re having a baby… infant/mother mortality rates are really low in China so there must be some kind of arrangement…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, when you go to the hospital the doctors will prescribe you lots and lots of medicine and want to do lots and lots of tests, many of which are utterly unconnected with your condition. This is to earn more money for the hospital. You actually have to decide for yourself which stuff you want to accept! Now, I don’t in theory object to earning money, but must it become so impossible to trust a doctor? Aren’t they supposed to be the people who you can most trust in times of dire need? It makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, if you have money and a doctor who you can trust, the healthcare is quite ok, better than many parts of the world. And there is medicine when you need it. Not to say of course that treatment for chronic conditions and muscular/skeletal injuries is generally excellent because Chinese medicine (I and various friends have found) is much more effective in this area. Although… you might want to go to a Chinese medicine specialist for that…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Afternoon tea at the Meritus</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/afternoon-tea-at-the-meritus.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to the Meritus for Afternoon Tea on Sat afternoon.  It was interesting - obviously not as classic as in England - no scones, no sandwiches - but as well as cakes with REAL CHOCOLATE they also had fresh salad and some hot (well, kept-warm) snacks.  Tea was extra, I had hot water.  Then they tried to charge 5rmb for the water!  But they took it off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was buffet style, 25rmb, I ate a lot, and it did for my dinner too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The residents’ bar/lounge is possibly one of the nicest bits of the Meritus, and you don’t need to be a resident to go in it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&quot;s raining, it&quot;s pouring...</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/its-raining-its-pouring.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it’s raining, and raining, and raining and oo, raining, come on, why so much water?  Last year we didn’t have enough, yesterday flooded the city centre for about the 4th time since March.  ENOUGH!  I feel sorry for the farmers.  The rest of us just have to wear silly ponchos when we ride our bikes and scooters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND it means we might miss the lovely months of June and July, hot and sunny but not like a pressure cooker, and no rain - perfect for the beach.  This year seems to have skipped these wonderful two months as well as the iffy month of May and gone straight into the monsoon of August, but without the heat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my friend told me His friend had told him there were going to be 7 typhoons in Shantou this June.  Ha, don’t quite believe that, but we def might be in for a rainy one.  :’(&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After the typhoon</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/after-the-typhoon.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I must comment that the single major after-effect of the typhoon on my life has been the insane number of mosquitos that hatched eggs as soon as the rain stopped.  It’s really quite crazy, they’re everywhere.  Good thing we don’t have malaria around these parts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Typhoon I</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/typhoon-i.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a typhoon! A TYPHOON! A real one! 11 on the scale of these things (max 14). I was quite excited, it was my first typhoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’d been rainy for a couple of days, then on Tue I was eating dinner in the school canteen and one of the school staff told me Shantou was having a typhoon that evening. Then someone else said it was Wed aft, then in evening class my student said it was going to miss us. It’s always a bit vague like that. Anyway went home that evening and while watching ‘House’ (the one with the doctor? Very well written, TVB Pearl.) my colleague told me that school had been cancelled by the government coz there was a typhoon tomorrow (Wed) aft. Wahey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s not good to be happy about typhoons. But I was a bit. Woke up on Wed to raining, and went out straight away to the market - no way I was starving. After that I didn’t really go out all day. Around midday the weather got really crap and by the afternoon the roads were flooding. I was sooo bored, so went to local internet bar for a bit. Then went home and by 5 o’clock it was a bit silly to go out by choice. The time of typhoon arrival got later and later, while the water got higher and higher, but the wind wasn’t extremely impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/53/151754175_6d4960cba1_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Well it got dark and I watched tv and studied Chinese. Oh and watched the Shantou channels for the little tickertape message updates about how far the storm was, and phoned my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By midnight it was really strong! Really strong! Things were creaking and cracking and smashing, scratching, metal, glass, other things. I can’t believe how late out some people were. When I went downstairs around midnight the doormen thought I was crazy and wouldn’t let me near the actual entrance - quite sensible really. The water was coming up the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features of interest: abandoned cars Everywhere. When I went downstairs there was an ambulance stuck outside my building. Lots and lots of water, and no street lights, which meant there wasn’t much to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning when I went out to have a look the water had gone down a lot - Huashan Lu was still swimming - I got a salinger to take me across, everywhere was filthy and although no cars had turned over, there were trees all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/47/151755346_b9cc52a852_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/51/151755513_084b0de818_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the cleanup has been very quick, most trees have already been hacked up and are waiting for collection, shops have been rinsed out and roads swept clean. The roads are also already dry, because today has been lovely and sunny, with a gentle breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a less happy note, there were almost no veggies in the markets today :( they’ve all been flattened, and I hear that two children were crushed by a house in the old city - it collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bbqs / hotspring</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/bbqs-hotspring.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mmm, just had lunch, it’s nice to be full.  Well had a reasonably quiet weekend…  Mainly taekwondo and eating, which generally speaking makes me happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went up to Dansuao Hotspring again last night.  This is just a little update to say that they’ve added a bbq hut/area, and it’s delicious.  I think it was mainly delicious because I wasn’t worried about getting ill - which I am when I eat bbq at most random roadside stalls.  I swear it’s not the food, it’s the sauces and spices they put on.  (Dansuao bbq has Excellent bbq sauce.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject, bbqs.  Many of my foreign friends really enjoy bbqs, unless they’ve been here a really long time and got ill one too many times.  My Chinese friends say they’re the most unhygenic crappiest places to eat in Shantou - but they still eat there sometimes.  It’s like getting a kebab on the way home from a night out (Brits), or you can spend an evening chilling in a park or beer garden and drink beer while eating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything’s laid out on sticks and you choose what you want then they bbq it for you and bring it over to where you’re sitting.  It’s possible to find just about anything - a wide variety of veg, meat/animal insides, seafood.  I personally recommend sweet potato anywhere, and mussels (are they mussels?  dan4cai4, I can read it but not type it) if you’re convinced you won’t get ill.  Beef balls are a local speciality.  The sweetcorn is never sweet, it’s a different variety.  Things usually cost 1 or 2rmb a stick.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Animal shelter</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/animal-shelter.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know Shantou has an animal sanctuary??!  They take in dogs and cats that no one wants, and sells them.  If you take them a cat, you pay 30rmb a month until someone else takes it home with them.  As fundraising doesn’t really work round here - too many people have used it for cheating, I think charging people to look after the cat they found is a good idea.  It’s cheaper than looking after it yourself, and you know the cat’s ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know all this?  Coz on Saturday afternoon I was cycling across the Jinsha East and Huashan Roads crossroads when I heard this screeching from the middle of the junction.  What was it?  A kitten!  I thought it’d been run over but when I cycled over I found it was just sat there.  It’s not like it could move - there were cars and motorbikes and all sorts on all sides.  Anyway it was really grotty and boney and above all smelly, so I stuck it in my basket and kept going.  It had string around its neck, who on earth owns a cat that small and mangy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying to give it away to some newsagents I got one of them to tape cardboard on the basket because it kept climbing out, and went to meet some people, then dinner, then taekwondo.  At tkd I had to start my lesson so the receptionist Kit retrieved the cat from my basket, fed it milk and contacted the shelter.  She knows because she also found an abandoned kitten once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were full and wouldn’t take it, but thankfully I’ve got my cat-loving friend Tammy to take it on until she leaves Shantou, thankgoodness.  I’m so not the person to be looking after a flea-infested-too-young-to-be-eating-food-and-away-from-its-mother kitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really loud though.  Definately got guts.  And yeah, Shantou has an animal shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Booking travel tickets</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/booking-travel-tickets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At New Year a group of my foreign-teacher friends nearly missed their hols because they didn’t know how things worked.  For anyone interested, particularly those used to European/North American-style planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their boss told them no one booked transport tickets before travelling.  HA!  Firstly, on national holidays, transport tickets, especially train and plane tickets, must be booked, and in some places the hotels get full too.  At other times it’s not so important.  However.  ‘Advance’ doesn’t mean three months in advance like in Britain.  I booked 9 days in advance for the May Day hol, although the earlier you book, the bigger the discount on the plane tickets.  If you book too close to the time for buses and trains, the prices go up.  New Year is probably best 3 or 4 weeks in advance - things go a bit crazy then.  If it’s not a national hol, hotels can be found, buses bought at the time (usually), and trains booked a couple of days before, max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, travel agents won’t spend 45min searching high and low for the best deal for you.  You have to ask the right questions to get the right answers.  No trains at that time?  What about the next train?  What about a different class?  They won’t automatically look for you.  The same for hotels - that’s the price?  Is there a discount?  Half day discount?  What about dorms?  If you ask for a room they’ll give you a standard twin with bathroom.  Think carefully, have a translator at hand, above all, be polite - and patient.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bob Hong&quot;s wedding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/53/143805806_dfa9a16bdc_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; My friend got married the Wednesday before the May Day holiday - it was a 好日子 (hao rizi - a Good Day for stuff like weddings and opening businesses). This was the first wedding of an actual friend I’d been to. As always the food was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who’s never been to a Chinese wedding before, they go to and from the bride and groom’s family homes asking for permission from parents and honouring ancestors. Then there’s the big meal and party which everyone comes to. During the 12-dish meal the bride and groom and family members will come and toast each table, technically each table should go to them too, but we actually never got round to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was mainly because the lady on stage kept on calling us up! First was for a game of Chinese whispers - but it’s not called that here. Then to sing a song. Guilia was called up and then me, she insisted on Xiao Wei 小微, then didn’t sing Any of it coz she said she couldn’t read Chinese! It was ok though, and one of my students was there and he and his friends brought us a rose each. All good fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish Bob and his wife all the best in their new life together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Women work and relationships</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/women-work-and-relationships.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve seen some stuff about the changing place of women in Chinese society. Most interesting were the essays my students wrote. I found the quiet girls were the ones with the most ‘modern’ attitudes! They wanted to not stop working, have their own business, and arrange for care of their children. The louder girls were more conservative, many wanting to give up work after having children for at least a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys thought women should give up working after having children, or have a less stressful job - so that they didn’t get bored. They also felt that couples should make sure they communicate enough and share some of the responsibilities with the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common train of thought was that if the man loved the woman enough, then he wouldn’t want her to work too much, because he could look after her (assuming economic demands didn’t require that she work). Another important factor in the reasoning process was the very high value given to children, and the welfare and happiness of the children. There was significant belief that children must be brought up by a parent/grandparent/close family member to ensure that they recieve enough love and don’t grow up rude and/or maladjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea written off by everyone upon hearing it was the idea of a husband giving up work to look after children. This appeared to be simply a stupid suggestion - the first question from everyone was - but then how would he provide for the family?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markets in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/markets-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of food, I just want to say what great markets Shantou has.  Prior to this weekend I thought they were standard throughout China, or at least the south.  Oh how I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Xiamen teaching my friend how to cook, and the markets were rubbish!  Yeah, plenty of seafood, veg and pork, but what about poultry and other animals?  Even the veg wasn’t the same.  Ever heard of beef?  In the end all we could make was pizza, coz it was vegetarian and in Xiamen you can buy cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even the small market near my house has an imaginative range of meat and poultry (although I never find lamb), and just about every veg I ever need, expect red peppers and courgettes.  The bigger ones like near tkd are even better (and cheaper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they cut everything for you, exactly how you want it, saves loads of time when cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou weather</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-weather.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It rained on Monday.  I woke up at 7.30 to a downpour amazingly similar to pouring a bucket of water from a great height (you couldn’t see through it), drifted off as it eased, then came to again at 9.00 to a similar downpour.  I don’t know how much it rained while I was asleep but all the roads in sight of my building and some of the pavements too were flooded.  Heheh it’s good to be on a high floor.  The poor scooter/motorbike/bicycle riders - well it was just too deep for the cyclists, they were on the pavement - riding up to nearly your knees in water can’t be fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Then in the afternoon it was so sunny the girls had their umbrellas out to keep their skin white. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Such is the weather in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Food prices</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/food-prices.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The price of chicken is only 6rmb/500g!  It has been for a few weeks.  There was a human case of bird flu in Guangzhou.  More chicken for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that unshelled mussels are a mere 2rmb/500g, what a deal, I’m sure they’re expensive in England.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>River boat trip</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/river-boat-trip.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went on a boat trip last night. It was a friend’s surprise birthday party and her boyfriend hired a small boat to drive up and down the river while we partied on it. So thoughtful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually you don’t have to hire your own boat, there’s a bigger one that leaves 9/9.30pm and does the same loop (up to one bridge, down to the other and back to port). I’ve been on it before, it gives a nice nighttime view of the city waterfront. I think it’s about 50rmb? Richard’ll know, he went on it last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t take your own snacks though, they’ll get annoyed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaves from Lundu(轮渡), next to the ferry to Queshi, opposite the swimming pool. On Haibin Road (海滨路) All drivers know it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://myshantou.net/the-wine-cellar-%E5%90%8D%E5%A3%AE%E9%85%92%E4%B8%9A.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was on my bike the other day and I came across a new wine bar, it’s called the Wine Cellar, it’s on the tree-lined avenue near LA Bar - the one between that collection of bars and Jinhuan Road.  The one that leads to Channel Five and Old Place bars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection is wider than Aussino - more countries (Italy, France, S.Africa, California, Australia main ones I remember), and I don’t think as expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely girl on the till. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Queshi Island</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/queshi-island.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weekends ago I went to Queshi. Now, before anyone puts a post on, I know Queshi isn’t an island, it’s only a river. But y’know, it feels like the sea and in fact it nearly is the sea, and people have to cross one of two bridges to get in and out of Shantou, so I often here of Queshi being called an island by English speakers. And it looks like an island and you have to take a ferry to get there if you don’t have a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ferry is 1rmb/person, or 2rmb for a motorbike. They leave about every 20min from the port, it’s called the 码头 (ma3 tou2) or 轮渡 (lun2 du4). It’s on Haibin Road (海滨路), opposite the outdoor pool and diving centre. Every driver knows it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway Queshi is lovely, once you get past the mad frenzy to get you on a vehicle it’s slow and quiet and pleasant and green. Straight ahead is the old British embassy, now a government building. If you turn left at the embassy you’ll find a school and a navy hospital. The navy hospital has a specialist burns unit which treated my friend when his back was badly burnt and the treatment was excellent. They have this special medicine. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn right and go up the hill and eventually you’ll get to the best middle school in Shantou, where all the brainy/rich kids go, and also the opportunity to climb up the surrounding hills. You have to pay about 10rmb to get in. The first one has the most stuff, caves, aerial runway, tobaggan run, golden Buddha, pagoda on top. If you don’t like too many people, which I don’t, keep walking up the road and go up some other hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went up one of the other hills with two friends from the hospital late in the afternoon. We found some army ruins - the man having a walk at the top said it was army, he didn’t know whose. Then he walked down with us through the winding winding paths, there are caves there too. It’s a good thing he came with us otherwise we would’ve got very lost and we didn’t have that much time. The man had a season ticket (whopping 60rmb/yr) and came up here about twice a week to chill out. He was cool. We climbed many steep upwards and downwards paths. It was a nice afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and an interesting thing: The character ‘que’ in Queshi(？石) is only found in Shantou. It won’t be in any of your dictionaries, so I can’t write it. How about that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shantou Survival Guide II</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/shantou-survival-guide-ii.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter comes from my daytime students, who this week have been studying under the topic of ‘crossing cultures’. It’s quite difficult to think of things to suggest to outsiders when you’ve never been outside your area, but they are a free-thinking group and they did well. As they are almost all Chaoshan locals or descendants of such people, it’s a good idea to listen to their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeans and t-shirts are ok for everyday clothes. You are expected to wear a school uniform when a school student. Wear dark colours at a funeral - no red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take off your shoes when you go into a home. Don’t break anything in other people’s homes. Don’t enter the parents’ bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful on public transport, there are a lot of theives. Be prepared to give your seat to an elderly person on public transport. When on one of the short or long distance (not city) buses, tell the driver where you want to get off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use two hands to give and receive gifts or anything to/from a superior. Say thank you when someone gives you a gift. Choose gifts for other people carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On photos, smile if you want. Check if it’s ok to take photos in temples first. Don’t take photos when people are sleeping. (I have a friend who has a large collection of photos of me sleeping! - I often fall alseep in his office/car.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be on time for appointments. Never get angry. Don’t kiss or hug friends to greet them. Don’t say too much (?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take enough money to pay for yourself when eating out but… don’t split the bill. Eat slowly, and not too much. Don’t eat and talk at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In small shops, markets and on the street, bargain. Compare prices before buying. Don’t steal…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jieyang farm and tombstones</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/jieyang-farm-and-tombstones.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it was my birthday on Sunday! What a great day! Last year was pretty crap coz at the time I still didn’t know very many people so basically I was on my own. This year I wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Jess came from Xiamen uni (where she’s studying Chinese and learning faster than I ever have) for the weekend, and on Sunday morning (well, midday) up she got and made us a pancake breakfast, which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon our friend Henry took us to his family’s farm in the countryside near Jieyang. It’s actually really near the Dansuao hotspring, just over the hill I think. The Chaoshan countryside is so nice. If you hired a taxi to get out there I reckon (on Henry’s assurance) that the farmers wouldn’t mind you wandering around, so long as you don’t break things. The lady on the farm might have thought me and Jess were a bit strange, we were very impressed with all the food actually Growing. There were bananas and green fruit and sugarcane and sweet potatoes and jielan vegetable and chickens and also leechees and dragon’s eyes that weren’t ripe yet. And a cow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/34/108984816_fd740572bd_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Also lots of gravestones scattered around the place, a good proportion of which are used as bridges to cross ditches, including one we found from the Qing dynasty. Apparently the countryside is full of this stuff if you look around for a bit. I once met an architect from Beijing, he’s really into collecting ancient stuff. He said he just goes to the countryside and asks around, then they pull out this stuff and he buys it for a couple of hundred rmb. I guess he knows what’s real, he’s good at it. There’s some Really ancient stuff in his house, I like old things so I find it interesting. They have been so many places.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chaoan temple</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chaoan-temple.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While we were at Henry’s farm (see Jieyang farm and tombstones) we went to the temple just down (up?) the road. It’s a very old temple, could probably call it ancient. The pinyin name is gan1lu4si4 (GanLu Temple), and it’s under a big rock on a hill in the middle of Nowhere and you have to climb about 300 steeeep stairs to get there. I actually came here with my mum and dad last October, but as my foot was broken, they went up with my friend and I made friends with the people at the bottom who sell things to sacrifice. I mean things like bottles of cooking oil and paper money! There was an old man there who had been in the navy. He had no teeth and was about 86, but he knew more English than anyone else on the stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/41/108983738_db8eecf5f4_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;He wasn’t there on Sunday though, they said he was at a temple near the university. It was nice to show them my healed foot. We came a little motorbike that me and Jess had to jump on while it was moving otherwise we were too heavy and it wouldn’t start. This was probably Jess’ favourite part because she loves motorbikes, but my favourite part was after we reached the actual temple. If you keep walking through, you get to the restaurant and toilet area (note: there are NO toilets with doors either below or at the temple). If you still keep walking through, you get into lots of little paths and really it’s up to you which ones you take. It was late in the afternoon and they were closing up - actually by the time we left they had to unlock the gate for us - so we didn’t get far. But we did find a big rock that looked reasonably climbable and indeed it was, well more or less. We weren’t the ones to see this though because the top of the rock was full of empty cigarette packets. I really want to go back and do some more wandering. It was like the time last year when my brother came to visit and we went to Dansuao resort (still under construction at the time) and climbed their hill, which also has some pleasant rocks at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/50/108983072_4152185e9b_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previously declared to myself that this shall be the year that I venture out into the general Chaoshan area, so tips of good places to go/eat at would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brazilian bbq</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/brazilian-bbq.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a comment that mentioned the Brazilian restaurant, I guess I should have said something before.  The Brazilian restaurant opened a couple of months ago and I think just about everybody in Shantou heard about it.  The result was that just about everybody in Shantou who could afford it, went, and so the food was pretty crap, mainly because there wasn’t any. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.  It’s a Brazilian barbeque.  I’ve been to Brazilian bbqs, in Brazil, so I can say that it’s reasonably authentic - the waiters carrying meat around, the buffet of hot and cold food, that’s what it’s really like.  Of course, it can’t rival the ones actually in Brazil (mmm…), but it would be unfair to expect it to.  It’s actually a chain from Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it got too crowded the kitchen just wasn’t producing enough food (and the soft drinks are Always flat), which made me feel slightly cheated of my money, but recently I went back with friends and it was much better.  The service has always been good, and it was still good, but more meat came around and the dishes on the buffet weren’t the scraps at the end of the tin or been there so long no one wanted to eat them.  It was a good meal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not cheap though…50rmb/head/buffet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Bbq, Jinsha East Road(金沙东路), the block between Hengshan衡山 and Tianshan天山 Roads.  In one of the new apartment buildings, ground floor. Phone:0754-8783210&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coffeehouse</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/coffeehouse.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went out for COFFEE last night.  I don’t usually drink coffee, but my friend invited me for coffee and I hadn’t seen him in ages so off I went.  I was actually planning to have tea but when I got there I couldn’t find any decent tea on the menu, therefore last night was the night of my first cappucino, and my third coffee ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   We went to UBC Cafe上岛咖啡, a chain from Taiwan.  It’s an upper-priced place that you can mainly drink coffee and eat at.  The food is ok, by Shantou standards quite bland but that’s the aim of chains right?  Know what you’re getting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   But it is a really nice place to drink coffee.  There are comfy chairs, well almost sofas really, and solid tables, plants and a live pianist in the evening.  The staff are polite, the menu is in Chinese and English, often with pictures.  A cup of coffee costs about 20-25rmb.  I have no idea what quality the coffee is as if I’m able to get it down my throat, I’m satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few.  I made it to two last night thanks to my motorbike driver who took me to the wrong one first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBC Cafe上岛咖啡, Jinyuan Road金园路，信佳超市旁边next to XinJiaChaoShi.  This is near the second main clothes shopping street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBC Cafe上岛咖啡, Dongxia东夏路 and Jinsha Road金沙路crossroads.  This is the same crossroads as the cinema, bowling alley, Pizza Hut, Deli Bar and not far from Walking Street步行街.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have updated the blog to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/download/&quot;&gt;latest version&lt;/a&gt;. And tonight I spent a bit time to look for a new template for it. Finally chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://irui.ac/cool-stuff/vslider&quot;&gt;Vslider&lt;/a&gt; which looks quite cool to me, hope it will be bring a new feeling to our readers and visitors as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I found some photos which I took before and some of them are from friends. After editing them into header image (as you can see above), I realised ‘Wow, Shantou is actually a very nice city!’. Surprised I just found my hometown is such a beautiful place after born and lived there for 17 years! It’s really ‘My Shantou’! Just press ‘F5’ in your keyboard and refresh the page, you will see more nice photos&lt;br /&gt;
So, here is our new look :) Hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile Phones</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/mobile-phones.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back! I’ve been in India for the past nearly three weeks so it’s been quite quiet, thanks Richard for the Valentine’s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it’s nice to be back, good to eat decent seafood and be back at tkd. The salinger drivers at the bus station all know me now, so they didn’t even bother me when I arrived back, didn’t even have to bargain :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, just took my friend to get a sim card for her mobile phone. For those who don’t know how that works here, let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have a sim card that you can use within Shantou City (this means also ‘boroughs’ like Jieyang and Chenghai), and you pay to make calls but not to receive them. Instead you pay about 7rmb a month. Or you can have a sim card that you can use anywhere in China (not Taiwan or Hong Kong), and you pay to receive AND make calls. Of course on both sim cards you can call to anywhere on the mainland and also receive text messages from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are both pay-as-you-go. Every time you need to top up, go to the booths that sell magazines, usally they top up cards for 50 or 100rmb. They’ll also top your phone up for you if you look helples, but it’s not actually difficult. After you dial the first number, press 2 and the language changes to English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get contract phones but I’ve no idea how they work and they seem to cost my friends a lot of money. The two kinds of cards I just talked about are both China Mobile cards. The local one is called a DaZhong(大众) card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a lot of junk text messages so ignore anything in Chinese if you can’t read it. Also, there are some ‘businesses’ that send messages and if you reply, it costs you a lot of money. Worse are the people that call you but hang up before you answer. When you ring them back, it’s an unbelievably high rate, I mean like 50rmb for a few seconds. So if you don’t know the number, I suggest you don’t ring back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case you’re confused that everyone in Shantou seems to have two phones, that’s because one will be a XiaoLingTong(小玲通) phone. These are phones without sim cards at all. You can only use them in Shantou City and they’re extremely cheap, but the reception is quite rubbish. People use them mainly for local phone calls. I don’t know if you can call outside the area with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&quot;s coming Valentines</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/its-coming-valentines.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As massive commercial influences every year, Valentines Day now has become an important day in Shantou too. Even mid-age couples also left housework and go out for romantic dinner or a date, not to mention those young ones. However, while everybody is doing the same thing of going out for such a ‘romantic’ night, standing out of the crowds maybe a better idea of having it with your partners, so here are a few places that I could think of to suggest you &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; to go on your well-prepared Valentines Days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hua Qiao Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unless you like kids running, chasing and shutting around, it’s really not a good place for couples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hai Bin Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, sound of wave moving and counting stars is a romantic scene. But if you want to create such a moment in Hai Bin Road, bear in mind that BBQ smells, chatting at a Gongfu tea table might also surround you and your girl/boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lin Bai Xin Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even for a normal date I won’t recommend there. However, for normal life, it is a good place to see Shantounese’ night life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Somewhere dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Considering Shantou is not a small city, you can find these kinds of place to have a little chat. But do consider another thing, Shantou has a big population too. You may think dark place is definitely no one can find, if you can, others too. So don’t be surprised when turn around and another couples say hi to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. If you both like over-volume music and don’t need to talk for the whole night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karaoke box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, but I don’t it’s got anything to do with the word ‘romantic’ though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for being so negative, but hope this will be helpful at some points. And if you’ve got some good places to recommend, feel free to leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taekwondo tournament</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/taekwondo-tournament.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh had the Shantou taekwondo tournament, it wasn’t as big as the Guangzhou one of course but it was still good. What to say? People fought taekwondo in the morning, and in the afternoon as well. Some people won and some people didn’t. I love taekwondo, and it’s also quite satisfying to kick someone in the head, not sure if that’s a good thing though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>People&quot;s Square</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/peoples-square.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Walked around the city’s People’s Square (Ren Ming Square) for the first time ever last night. I usually hang around Linbaixin Square, the one opposite Walmart, because it’s near my house and anyway it’s got grass, but last night was passing through the older part of town so we stopped to chill and look at the musical fountain. Chaozhou beats Shantou hands down for fountains, gotta say that! But the Chaozhou musical fountains are really quite famous (and very big) and it’s probably unfair to compare. The Shantou one is nice enough for an evening stroll. Big plus is it’s on Haibin Lu, next to the ferry terminal, and there’s a swimming pool there too (summer only, are you crazy wanting to swim in winter).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Year soon!</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/new-year-soon.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/37/102945345_bf44a8b137_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;I am amazed at how some street vendors keep a straight face when stating a price. It’s New Year’s Eve tomorrow and so there are pots of flowers and inedible-orange (my name, not theirs) trees all over the place to be bought. The big red flowers are about 10rmb a pot, the starting price should be 15rmb. It’s amazing how seriously some can say 35rmb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t know whether to buy an inedible-orange tree, they’re cool but it’s not like lots of people will be visiting my house, as I’m going travelling on Monday for nearly three weeks. Might stick with big red flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mm, New Year, that crazy time when everyone has to increase their prices so they can afford all the other increased prices, no wonder there’s so many thieves. I feel that I have missed out on something never being a child in China, I think New Year must be cool for them! But some friends tell me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/myshantou/102945106/&quot;&gt;all the money&lt;/a&gt; they get given was always taken straight away hehe - their mum’s used it to give to other children. What comes around goes around!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another Japanese restaurant</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/another-japanese-restaurant.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Bill is moving to Australia with his family after New Year so last night he took me out for dinner to say goodbye and we went to a Japanese restaurant. That makes five that I know of in Shantou and there still isn’t a single Korean restaurant. Entrepreuneurs in the catering industry: OPEN A KOREAN RESTAURANT IN SHANTOU. People often tell me their favourite foreign food is Korean yet Shantou has not a single restaurant, what are you all doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was very nice actually. It wasn’t insanely expensive like Narita, but more expensive than the one on Changping Lu with the girl outside. Actually it’s next-door-but-one to that very restaurant. Second floor, quiet, nice service, but they charge you 2元 for red tea, cheapskates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grr</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/grr.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was on the bus (route 2) two days ago and the boy next to me cut my pocket open with a knife and stole my mp3 player!  The cheek of it!  I only discovered just as he’d got off the bus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about 20min before that a young boy about 13 yrs old had tried to pickpocket me.  I’d read about it in the local newspaper so when he veered off and joined two men and another boy, I knew he was definitely a thief.  Honestly, I give up.  I’m not buying nice things any more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wild animal restaurant</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/wild-animal-restaurant.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My second point is completely different (previous post: Warped space and size in the Chaoshan area), so is here.  Yes, I was invited by a friend’s friend to go with them to Chenghai(澄海).  This is where this group of friends are all from originally, and some of them still are, they were middle school-mates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   We went, of course, to eat.  The restaurant specialised in wild animals.  I have no idea how wide a selection is available, I’m not even sure if free range here actually count as wild, because I’m pretty sure most animals are factory farmed near the cities, otherwise there wouldn’t be enough space to breed enough meat. I know the chickens are factory farmed.  Anyway it was a long way down the Shantou-Chenghai road, through Chenghai and out the other side, then make a u-turn in the road and turn right down a dirt track.  All the most local specialities are down dirt tracks.  Why is everything so well-hidden?  So many people would come if only there were signposts.  Ha, maybe that’s why there aren’t any. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Well it was hotpot and lots of meat from some wild animal, some green vegetables and some wild seafood (a lot of seafood, especially fish, is reared on farms), it was delicious and I wish I could tell you where it was so you could go too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Also we drank a couple of bottles of bai jiu (rice wine?), which in the company of these particular friends I’m quickly learning to down several glasses of in quick sucession.  I’m much more used to drinking volume at my own chosen pace (Western style), but as you have to wait for an opportunity to drink with other people, it means chance to drink is less, so more should be drunk at one time.  And also, as in every country, it’s a matter of pride to match/out-drink your friends.  My stomach was originally not impressed, but is getting used to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Warped space and size in the Chaoshan area</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/warped-space-and-size-in-the-chaoshan-area.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday night I was taken for a rare trip to Chenghai.  There are two points in this story.  The first is how little I travel around the Chaoshan area.  Actually it’s probably the size of Greater Manchester plus a bit, and when in England I regularly travel across the widest parts of Manchester, and often cover most of the North of England without thinking about it.  But when I’m in Shantou, the tv tower is distant (the other side of town), Chenghai is a trip (25 min drive), and Chaozhou (50 min drive) is practically an expedition.  Why is this?  Guangdong is bigger than all of Great Britain put together, but I don’t know a single place to eat in Chenghai or Jieyang, and only a couple in Chaozhou.  It’s like space is bigger here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Actually I quite like it.  Sometimes I realise just how small my geographical world has become and feel claustrophobic, but only for a couple of minutes.  A lot of my friends have never left Guangdong, and for many more the limit is Fujian, which is culturally almost the same as the Chaoshan area and just a little further on than Chenghai.  I guess if you don’t know how big things are, then your space really is bigger.  And that feeling translates to me too, even though I know very well how big things are.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese tv</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chinese-tv.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel I have acheived something. After nearly two years in China, I’ve finally become hooked on a Chinese soap opera. This is makes me very happy, because it not only means that my language is becoming really functional, but also I have some cultural link (Tv is a very important medium!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer and more recently I was in situations which meant I have been watching Chinese tv with Chinese people. Watching tv with the people of that country is much better because they always seem to find the good tv programmes, which I’ve never been able to do. The final trigger to make me feel really comfortable in front of Mandarin language tv was I think Christmas weekend when I was in Guangzhou with taekwondo. We were resting for fighting and had no money anyway, so we spent a lot of time in the hotel rooms watching tv. The lad with the remote always seemed to find horror films, now I’m back in Shantou I can’t find any! Maybe it’s the tv they get in Guangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway the one I watch is on Anhui tv, it’s modern day (dramas here are split between modern day and ancient times), and completely daft, but aren’t all soap operas? I am, however, hooked, and I watch it every evening I’m in. It took three months in Brazil and nearly two years in China, but hey, 慢慢来 (slowly slowly come).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pork noodle breakfast</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/pork-noodle-breakfast.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At present I am eating my breakfast (when I have time to eat breakfast) at a place on the street near my house. They set up in the early hours, are selling from around 6am on, and start cleaning up around 10.30am. By midday they are gone and there’s just a corrugated iron table to show they were ever there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sell bowls of noodles (grain or rice, you can choose) with assorted pig insides, some seafood and vegetables. This is a really common dish here for all quick meals but their food is such good quality at such an excellent price (3 or 5rmb), and no stringy or fatty meat in sight, if you don’t want it. I usually have glass noodles with pork meat, shell fish and lettuce. Mm, it’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find it fascinating how they bring everything, from the ingredients to the stools and tables, to the hot coals for the sterilising water. I bet they even take the gas because otherwise wouldn’t someone nick it? But I’m not sure, I’ll have to look next time I pass by.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beer bars and temples</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/local-religion.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was out with a friend the other night when he announced that between bars we woud be going to the temple. It was to give the bi-monthly respects and offerings that people traditionally do round here. I say monthly - I mean the lunar month. At every new moon and full moon you can smell burning paper all around Shantou and more fruit in front of the little alters in all the shops and homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper ‘money’ is burnt and fruit offered, as far as I can gather, as a sign of respect to the god to ensure good fortune, I’m honestly not quite sure which god though. I’m not sure a lot of people here are clear about the matter either, it’s just that it definately is a good idea to do it for good luck. These days not many young people are interested, in fact I find them just as agnostic as British youth. However, some young people do still go, and my friend and his older brother (two good looking lads in their twenties) are two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time there was six of us, because three friends also came. They asked me if I wanted to ‘bai’ (拜) and although I said no (I’m a Christian, it’s not possible), I’m sure they still bought me a bag of paper and incense and offered it anyway. I don’t know the English of ‘bai’. ‘Pray’ doesn’t quite cover it, and ‘sacrifice’ makes me think of blood. Maybe ‘offer’ could be the right word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I was very happy to have the opportunity to go. The temple was down Changping Road, past the Lotus supermarket, then off to the right on a dirt track and on some derelict land you have this small but fully functional temple. The place was quite full, and there were lots of cars and motorbikes. Really it was two outside shrines but covered, and at the back some people were doing puppet opera, the first time I’ve ever seen it really done. Their music was blasted through loudspeakers, plus you had the gong gonging all the time. It was loud and busy. There were piles of paper money and fruit everywhere, some of it really big. Some people also offered massive incense sticks, which burned slowly out the back, they really were enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends went around and poured oil into lamps and took smaller incense sticks and prayed in front of both alters. There were about fifty other people all doing the same thing at the same time, all in quite a small space, so it was a good thing there were no walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we continued on to the next bar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Year 2005/6</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/new-year-20056.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! Long time no write. Happy Christmas too! Christmas in Shantou might have been good, but I was in Guangzhou fighting in a taekwondo competition, so I wouldn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was, however, in Shantou this past weekend, which was New Year, well the solar calender new year. This isn’t such an important event at all here, in fact a lot of my friends just went to bed after a nice meal and a bit of tv at home, so I took the opportunity to party with predominantly foreign friends, it being a foreign festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://myshantou.net/?p=26&quot;&gt;LA Bar&lt;/a&gt; about five minutes before midnight, just in time for the countdown, which really kicked the night off. From then on in it became one of those nights… Unfortunately I ate something very bad for dinner and spent midnight to 4am either throwing up or waiting to throw up, but the staff were very nice and let me use an ice bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like the whole of Shantou, or at least everyone I know who wasn’t at home watching tv, were in LA that night, which was nice. Generally it was a very good New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished the night with other friends I met in LA, but the group of foreigners I came with I think went on benders in twos and threes. I am already being told about friends of friends who were in LA and saw lots of foreigners dancing on a podium, a Portuguese and a Central American boy discovered just how many rooms LA had, because they went into them all wishing everyone happy new year, and discovered a room full of models in the process, they were very happy, and as I was leaving I passed another Portuguese and a South African boy in a big crowd (they don’t speak Chinese) pretending to ride someone’s go-faster motorbike just outside the entrance, posing for photos. What’s more, I think the owner was on the bike too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, another excuse to write about taekwondo (tkd)! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 22 January 2006, the Shantou Taekwondo Association will be holding the Shantou winter taekwondo tournament. Categories: children, teenagers, adults. Split by weight and belt. Time and address coming as soon as I know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wahey! Are you fighting? Are you watching? I’m fighting (assuming I don’t hurt myself in the Guangzhou competition this weekend). See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/myshantou/78967117/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/39/78967117_61c5e94129_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gongfu Tea&quot; title=&quot;Gongfu Tea&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Saturday night I was called out by a friend to join him and two others to drink tea.  This is one thing I really love about here, and apparently it doesn’t happen so much outside the Chaoshan area.  The whole of Shantou, and I guess the Chaoshan area, is dotted with tea houses (茶馆).  They’re usually on the second floor - maybe it’s quieter a bit higher up, or outside in tea gardens.  And whereas people go out for a pint in England, they go out for tea in Shantou.  (Alcohol is usually drunk at speed here.)  In the national chains such as MingTian (名典) and ULC, there’s lots of wierd and wonderful teas and even coffees to have, but if you want genuine Chaoshan tea, you need to go to one that’s probably independent, or somewhere outside.  (Although it’s also available in the chains.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/myshantou/78967117/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The tea, or rather the way of making tea, is special to this area. It’s called ‘gongfu cha’ (功夫茶), which translates as kungfu tea, hehe. This is because it takes so much effort to make it! Well, I think so anyway, that’s what I was told. You have a round tea set with a round bowl with a lid which is the teapot. And there are always three cups. This is traditional, but also it’s because the teapot pours about three cup’s worth of tea. One cup is about one mouthful - if you have an asbestos mouth, because the tea must be boiling hot, preferably freshly boiled. Some older people here definately have asbestos mouths. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You pour boiling water into the cups and then (usually) pick them up with your hands and wash them inside each other one by one, may I add that asbestos finger tips are also handy here. I have been taught to hold the rims and move quickly so that it doesn’t hurt (ha, much).  Boiling water is poured onto tea in pot, after a few seconds this is emptied out, THE FIRST POT CAN NEVER BE DRUNK.  Aparently the tea must be washed first. Water added a second time, left for a bit, then poured.  People drink, talk, and when the pourer feels like it, s/he will cleans the cups again and pour another round. Tea is usually some kind of oolong or black tea I think - not quite clear on this yet, I go for ‘tie guan yin’ (铁观音) always, because it’s popular and good - a Fujian tea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of tea drinking here is not to drink tea, although pouring tea is an art form.  It is talking, and this I like very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taekwondo - tkd</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/taekwondo-tkd.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The time has come to talk about taekwondo (tkd).  I love tkd (跆拳道).  It is a well-known (and possibly slightly frustrating) fact among those that know me, and I go at least three times a week.  Five is better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Tkd is the Korean martial art, and actually very popular in China.  Really any martial art is popular in China.  I go to New Power Taekwondo (新力量跆拳道), the owner of which is the bloke who started tkd in Shantou.  The big centre is on Baihua Lu 白花路 (near Dongxia 东厦), and there’s another one up Changping Lu 长平路.  I really love tkd so let me rave for a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    It’s mostly a kicking sport (to the chest, sides and head), but you get to punch too.  It gets you incredibly fit, really, unbelieveably fit.  You sweat a lot!  Often people ask me what my reasons are for doing tkd - mainly it’s to keep fit (I need to eat a lot so therefore I need to exercise a lot), and a close second is a place to take out all that pent-up anger/frustration/loneliness/boredom/dispair that you’re not allowed to express in China.  I find tkd really focusses my mind.  You only really learn to street-fight (self defence) once you get to black belt and up, it’s not judo or sanda 散打 (I don’t know the English of sanda.  All sanda students punch fantastically).  It’s a martial sport, rather than art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Our classes are mostly in the evening, adults Mon-Fri, starting either 8.30 or 8.45, about 75 or 90 min long.  They’re split into two groups, beginners and high belt (high belt - green up).  Sat and Sun afts also have classes, all age.  Beginners at 3pmish and high belts at 4.30.  The adult classes average age - early twenties.  Most students are either high school or late twenties, although some go right up to the forties.  Mostly they’re lads!  We have a nice group of girls that are all red belts now though (inc me), about 6 of us.  There are usually about 10-15 students per instructor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Yeah, belts.  Like this: white, yellow, green, blue, red, black.  Black up are the dans - 1-9.  Assuming regular training 3/4 times a week, it takes 2-3 months to get to green, about 18 months to get to black, and ages to get anything above 1st dan!  The owner, Chen Wei 陈维, is 5th Dan (instructor trainer), then we have four full-time jiaolians 教练 (instructors), 4th Dan (senior instructor) - Li李 and Weng翁 Jiaolian, then Shen沈 and Zhuang庄 Jiaolian are assistant instructors.  Mainly you would just call them ‘jiaolian’, though.  They are (ahem not bad looking) lads, all in their early/mid-twenties.  Chen Jiaolian is in his early thirties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   I think they all teach great, and they’re nice lads too.  Li jiaolian speaks pretty good English (although he always says he doesn’t) his English name is Jion, and Zhuang jiaolian has got some basics.  Anyway you don’t need any language, you just copy.  Oh I forgot to say about Xiao Mao (Kitten) 小猫 on the front desk, she’s the smiley girl with big eyes, and don’t forget Ayun阿运, Chen jiaolian’s wife, she’s often on the front desk too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Let me repeat one more time: I love tkd, everyone should try it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sttkd.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.sttkd.com/&lt;/a&gt; - but it’s all in Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;白 花路东厦运动场  BaiHua Lu, DongXia YunDong Chang (Sports Ground).  You really can’t miss it.  There’s also a basketball court, badminton hall, running track and gongfu centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, prices - you buy per time period and go to as many lessons as you want during that time.  Like this: 1month- 200rmb, 3month- 500rmb, up to one year.  Also the clothes are 200rmb.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beginners guide to survival in Shantou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/beginners-guide-to-survival-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please add your own tips as you feel suitable.  Survival in Shantou for the complete beginner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Never get angry.  If possible, don’t even get visibly annoyed.  (I’m crap at this.)  [WHY- To get angry here makes you look stupid and embarresses anyone nearby.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) When crossing the road, never change speed or direction, never stop.  You’ll see what I mean.  [WHY- This way, the traffic knows where you’re headed and can plan where they’re headed without crashing into you.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Food is fresh which means it’s alive when you order.  This is a good thing.  [WHY- Food quality is extremely important, this way you know your food isn’t off.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Never touch food with your hands, unless you have large stack of tissues to clean hands immediately afterwards.  [WHY- Because your hands are dirty and dirt shouldn’t go in your mouth.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Many people find foreigners who look foreign (ie not Chinese) a great novelty.  Think back to when your country was monoethnically populated with only a few exceptions, and be patient.  It’s natural.  [WHY- ‘Helloooo!’  ‘I love you!’  ‘Can we be friends so I can practice my English?’  *astonished stares*  *bemused stares*]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Always get a vocal agreement (grunt and nod is ok) on price from taxi, salinger and motorbike drivers BEFORE you get on their vehicle.  If you want to give a generous price, agree a generous price, don’t tip.  Then they expect it off the rest of us.  If they ask for more when you leave, don’t give in at any cost.  Never give them money until you see the change in their hand.  [WHY- If you don’t look Chinese, you tend to get ripped off more often than average.  A sad fact but unfortunately true.  It pays to be polite but cautious, and stand up to cheaters so that they learn.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Toilets are usually a hole in the ground (much more hygenic in a public situation don’t you think?), take your own loo roll and if you can’t find a button, flush by pouring water from near bucket down toilet.  [WHY- That’s just how toilets are usually built round here.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Apparent lack of emotion is neither coldness nor lack of emotion.  It is probably courtesy, or officialdom.  Occasionally both.  [WHY- Different cultural assumptions about what is polite/warm behaviour, and when it is necessary.] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) Hold your own in a queue.  If other people aren’t queueing, don’t try.  [WHY- I haven’t worked out why people don’t like queueing here.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) When drinking, never drink alone - always cheers with someone first, gan bei if you can.  It’s a really sociable way to drink.  [WHY- That’s just how drinking is done here.  It feels more sociable.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) The best food is in the most unexpected and inconspicuous places!  Trust where your friends take you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really these are probably valid in all of China.  I can’t believe how many foreigners, particularly Westerners, come here and don’t know anything basic about local culture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Live musical - Pippin</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/live-musical-pippin.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/34/72867264_118999d7c3_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantou University is in the midst of its annual 3-day English Festival. Last night I went to watch a play there. Imagine this. It was a broadway musical called ‘Pippin’, performed in China, by Chinese students, in English. And it was really good! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was impressed at how successful they were with the general standard of production.  However, the singing and dancing was also very good and, well, the show was entertaining, which is what I find a lot of stage productions are not, in England.  Theatre is a bit like wine - some people all know what to say when they should say it, but to anyone who doesn’t know about the ins and outs, good wine is good wine, and a good show is a good show, whatever the ’authoritative’ assessment is.  And a lot of what ‘They’ say is good in theatres, is actually really boring anyway.  Art can be a bit like that too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was packed out as 10% excess tickets had been printed on the assumption that not everyone would come - the three nights are all free - but everyone came.  Glad there wasn’t a fire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there were subtitles!  A great idea - I never hear all the words, from native speakers or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view more photos from Pinpin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/myshantou/tags/pinpin/&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deli Bar</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/deli-bar.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to Deli bar (De Li) bar last night, also known as The Beer Bar because it’s the only place in Shantou that sells its own-brewed beer.  They sell it by the jug.  It’s quite inconspicuous - on the second floor opposite Pizza Hut on Jinsha Lu.  It’s also one of the few places in Shantou where you can drink in a bar-like environment without ridiculously loud music.  I don’t think I’ve written about it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entrance is just stairs leading up.  At the top turn left and then you’re inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jinsha Dong Lu (金沙东路), at the crossroads for Walking Street (Bu Xing Jie 步行街).  Pizza Hut and Mc D’s opposite.  Coming from the Golden Gulf, and the Meritus, it’s the crossroads after YiDu cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seafood and Walmart Street</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/seafood-and-walmart-street.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another seafood shop.  Well, it’s Shantou’s speciality.  This one is right outside Walmart.  Behind Walmart there are some bars (Sunglow, Triumphal, Manhattan).  Next to Triumphal there’s one of the main entrances to the back of Walmart, and outside it there are many, many restaurants.  This is the street generally recognised among my English-speaking friends as Walmart street, or sometimes Skank Alley.  It starts at a northern food restaurant just outside the Golden Gulf, and ends on Changping Lu with some new western food joint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   However, the food really worth eating is all in the middle, and number several dumpling restaurants, a good internet cafe (3rmb/hr non-members), some noodle soup restaurants, a Muslim restaurant, a barbeque, and some seafood restaurants.  The food is generally all very edible and I haven’t ever heard of cheating around there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   The seafood restaurant I know best is 心香各 (XinXiangGe) but no one really knows it’s name.  If you come out of the gates from Walmart and turn left, there’ll be a newsstand - the first (and only) restaurant next to it is 心香各.  You can sit outside or inside.  They are friendly.  You choose your food outside.  As long as you don’t order expensive things like crab, a decent meal costs about 15rmb per head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;心香各  丹霞西街南国商城东侧  XinXiangGe  DanXia, West Street, South China Mall east side.  Phone:8267248&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Northern restaurant - spicy</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/northern-restaurant-spicy.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post once, but then our school internet went offline and it was lost when I tried to send it grr.  So apologies if I can’t muster the enthusiasm for details.  Let’s see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I went and had food at the Northern Restaurant (北国饭店).  I love this restaurant, it’s good quality, has a good reputation locally, you can get your own side room, the service is POLITE and HELPFUL, and the menu has pictures.  Also the toilets usually have toilet paper.  For all this a meal usually costs 20-30rmb per person, so it’s not cheap.  The more people the better, because more dishes can be ordered.  Booking is necessary on weekend evenings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, my observations tell me that ’north’ is anywhere from Sichuan up (well, it’s still a long way).  The common denominator is the heat - there are a few words I think, I know two of them: ‘la4’ (spicy) and ‘ma2la4’ (spicy that makes your tongue numb).  There’s Sichuan, Henan, northern and hotpot restaurants, and they all have their own specialities (see ‘hotpot’ post).  I love them all, because I love spicy hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;北国饭店：大洋总店  海滨路33号大洋商厦 &lt;br /&gt;
BeiGuo FanDian:DaYang  Haibin Lu, no.33, DaYang. &lt;br /&gt;

BeiGuo FanDian:YangGuang  Hanjiang Lu, YangGuang HuaYuan (Garden). &lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Massage II (foot)</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/massage-ii-foot.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently went to another very good foot massage place.  It’s called HaiLong Foot Massage Centre, and my friend who took me (he lives in the vicinity of one of them) says it’s quite well-known in Shantou.  They certainly do good foot massage.  I think it was 35rmb for just over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;海龙足道  HaiLong ZuDao  HaiLong Foot Massage Centre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大洋店：滨港路5号海韵华府120  DaYang branch: Bingang Lu, no.5, HaiYunHuaFu 120.  Phone: 8575456  NB,This is also near Zhongshan Lu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cinema - Harry Potter</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/cinema-harry-potter.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/12/68525621_b6a641a2d9_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Harry Potter is still on at YiDu cinema - I went to see it last night. It was great! The first decent HP film I’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any other cinemas in Shantou?  I’ve heard rumours there are, but never actually met someone who’s been to one.  Actually a lot of my students have never been to the cinema.  At 30rmb a time, I’m not surprised.  It’s not like it’s state-of-the-art equipment or anything.  Small upstairs (more expensive-35rmb) cinema better than the big one.  However, big one very communal watching experience, and actually I like that.  I wish the seats were bigger, I feel a bit over-sized in there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YiDu cinema/theatre is on Jinsha Road, at the big crossroads which the bowling alley is just off, and the big crossroads before Pizza Hut/McD’s/Deli Bar.  There’s usually two films playing, one Chinese-language and one foreign-language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woohoo! Richard has taught me how to put photos on this blog. So here goes the first one just to try… It’s from my balcony (I live next to the Golden Gulf Hotel).  The photo looks at Jinsha Road.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a quiet (restful) two weeks, but I’m back.  Not only am I back at tkd (see next post), I’m back to eating out.  There’s a little seafood restaurant just off Huashan Road that you can’t see unless you walk into the flats back there.  It’s got great food, really fresh.  The seats are all outside and you point at the food you want cooked.  I always go there with a particular friend.  It gets really busy at meal time though, so don’t arrive at 6.30pm.  (*Cultural note - mealtimes in Shantou are midday and 6pm, although it’s possible to arrange to eat with friends, oo, up to half an hour after that.  I quite like that eating is so important, but it does mean restaurants can get very crowded, then close.  Most of my foreign friends eat later anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/35/68220299_ffbfd1e830_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you find it?  Well… on Huashan Road 华山南路 (between Changping and Jinsha Roads), there’s a store called the Blue Cat Store or something.  It’s very blue.  Turn into the little almost-pedestrianised side alley next to it, and there’ll be two similar restaurants at the end.  I’m talking about the one on the left.  It’s name is Huang Ji 黄记 restaurant, but no one actually knows it’s name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good meal for four, including posh dishes such as crab, costs about 60-70rmb.  I recommend crab, any shellfish (because I don’t know their names), the yellow tofu, most of the soups - mushroom in particular, sweet n sour fish/prawns.  Mm is good.  Actually I recommend everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黄记饮食店 丹霞庄中区4幢101  HuangJi restaurant, DanXia Zhuang, middle section (zhong qu), building (dong) 4, no.101  Phone no: 8168720&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photo shop</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/photo-shop.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Must make an unapologetic plug for my friend’s photo shop. Fortunately, Digital City is both extremely convenient (at Jinsha Dong bus station, bright yellow, Kodak) and cheap, possibly the cheapest in Shantou.  According to Henry, my friend, the photoshops are in a constant price war, so I wouldn’t like to assume, but 6x4 digital photo is 0.79rmb, quite cheap I think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough on the cheapness.  I met Henry at his shop about a year ago, he’s a good friend and you should all support his business.  Oh and you can order photos over the internet, send them over and specify size etc, they’ll process them and you pick them up.  They have QQ, dunno about msn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the only one to process stuff there, other people also pass the word on, although the Irish girls still insist on going to Fuji which is I don’t know where. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry is also the person who has put up clear English language signs all around Jinsha Dong bus station, which I hope you find helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LA Bar</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/la-bar.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think it’s time I introduced LA Bar (洛城). Almost every local person I meet in Shantou often goes to LA Bar - the conversation goes something like this: (general introductions) local:’Where do you like going out to?’ Me:’Oh, lots of places. If it’s a club, I often go to LA.’ local:’So do I! I go there all the time!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes indeed, LA has risen to a be a central place in Shantou party culture - especially among the 20-30 somethings. I think it’s because the atmosphere isn’t as crazy (insane) as Zero (零点), and there’s not really such a problem with the darker side of the entertainment industry, which some of the other clubs have. Now, I’m no expert, the aforementioned isn’t an area I wish to know about particularly, so don’t quote me, but LA is widely regarded as a nice place to have a party with nice people. I have also never heard of a fight there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s still a Chinese bar, which means loud, loud music and no one dancing, but hey, that’s how it’s done here. Before 11 o’clock the music is really good and not too loud - it’s the dance/hip hop stuff you’d get in England. Personally I prefer this. After 11 o’clock it becomes dance - mixed and everything, it’s better than most places - very loud and dancing unusual. Of course, you could dance on the platforms the dancing girls use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention it at this time because they have just opened a new floor - the 4th floor - it’s much bigger and still just as popular with locals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;洛城酒吧 金沙东路 LA Bar, Jinsha Road, almost opposite the Golden Gulf.  There’s a load of bars there.  Any taxi/motorbike/salinger driver knows it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wine bar - Aussino</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/wine-bar-aussino.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where have I been this week. Some ex-teachers came back from travelling before leaving China, these past couple of days. An American couple called David and Elizabeth. I’m really sad that they’ve left! Well this necessitated going out a lot to enjoy final moments together, including a trip to wine bar Aussino, lunch at veggie rest., hotpot and foot massage. Ah, such luxury.&lt;br /&gt;
Aussino is a recently opened wine bar stocked with foreign wines and an increasing range of foreign manufactured produce such as CHEESE (cheddar, edam, mozzerlla and others) - reasonable price - tortillas and olives. Their canned spaghetti sauce, mayo and tinned tuna is also available in Walmart for cheaper. But Aussino is not just a place to buy wine, oh no, upstairs there’s a lounge which has things like carpets and sofas that are not-too-squidgy-not-too-hard and good service. I left before midnight coz working the next day but I know the others - around 10 of them I think - partied hard well into the night. There are photos, but only on Snappy, the Irish girls’ trusty see n snap camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/34/68219623_f888175f8d_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/35/68219549_c8e53e3815_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aussino is on the corner of Changping Road (长平路) and Huashan Road (华山南路). You can’t really miss it because it’s full of windows and stocked to the brim with winebottles and strong lighting. Upstairs is not so strong lighting!   I hear cheapest bottle of wine (1/2 bottle) is 50rmb.  If you don’t know where this corner is, it’s just near Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Veggie restaurant - Lian Hua</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/veggie-restaurant-lian-hua.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember whether I’ve written about the veggie restaurant, Lian Hua, but it’s worth writing twice - it’s a Buddhist restaurant on Haibin Lu (海滨路), it is excellent food. The food could be meat in taste, texture, smell and look, but it isn’t. Great piece of mind therefore. You can eat full for 20rmb, the more people the better, of course, because then more dishes. The bird’s basket with sweet n sour sauce is it’s most famous dish. My foreign friends also really like the Peking duck. I love the mushroom soup. If you can’t read Chinese, there are set meals for 2 to 12 or so people, just choose the relevant number. Mmm it’s so good. The only bad thing is that if you’re foreign it usually takes at least 7 waitresses to take an order for two people. One to take the order and 6 to stand around gawping.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Massage</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/massage.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/20/68220027_4abdd8feee_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Right final review, foot massage. The Chinese really know a lot about massage, it’s used all the time in medicine, and also many places are ‘men only’ (grr), but there are plenty more that are open to anyone who just wants to relax in a non-dodgy sense.  My foot is still not great but yesterday I went to this massage and it when the lad had finished, I could hardly feel any weakness in my foot at all!  Foot massages usually cost about 30-40rmb, body ones around 100rmb.  The Chinese approach to the body being holistic, you don’t just get your feet massaged, it’s your legs, oh and your back as well, oh and don’t forget the arms too.  Good enough for me!  They last about 1hr - you know I always forget to time it so I don’t know.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night there were 9 of us so we were sat in a big room with 9 chairs. They’re big armchairs, it’s great. Actually usually I don’t enthuse about them as much as other foreigners do, but last night cured my foot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also common are hair washes at hairdressers’ - that includes a head and neck massage, you don’t have to get your hair cut (usually 20rmb). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are good places? The one I go to most is just behind Jinsha Road 金沙东路 (near Jinsha Dong bus station 金沙东站), just off Huashan Road 华山南路 (can you tell I live in this area?), next to Little Bee restaurant (小蜜蜂).  It’s on the second floor, from the street it’s just an open door with a staircase.  (Address n nuo. see below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hair washing, there’s a hairdresser’s just near it on Huashan Road called Avant-Courier, that’s ok.  My personal favourite is United Star (联星) on Changping Road (长平路), the massage there is always great, never too scratchy. They must train their staff well. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hotpot restaurants</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/hotpot-restaurants.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While on the subject of food, let’s talk about hotpot. Hotpot is often eaten at home in winter because it’s fresh, extremely convenient, and hot. At home it’s a hotplate with a dish of soup on top. Go buy what you want to boil, make your dipping sauce (rely heavily on garlic) - start cooking. Fantastic communal meal. Meat, sea food, veg, it all goes in and you watch it boil and pick out what you want. Officially hotpot is a northern/central thing, but it’s popular here in the way Chinese, Indian or Thai is in England. Well, China is bigger than Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a big meal out with a lot of friends or sometimes for a date, although this is a far better event with lots of people, can go to hotpot. Actually hotpot is most like Indian. After a big night out, people will go and eat hotpot, they’re about the only restaurants open all night. The equivalent of a kebab is bbq (烧烤), found on the street anywhere. Anyway, hotpot. Yes I already explained the basics except in the Sichuan restaurants - I think Hunan and Northern restaurants (yes, it’s all different food) also have them - you get spicy soup, oh my word yes it’s spicy. Luckily yingyang dishes can be provided which means you get half spicy half not, or you can have majority one. It’s all very clever. But the spicy stuff is fantastic. I really love hotpot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of hotpot (火锅) and spicy (northern/Sichaun四川菜) restaurants in Shantou.  The ones I know how to give directions to…  There’s one round the corner from the Meritus (君华大酒店), that’s good.  There’s another further down the same road.  There’s one opposite Jinsha Dong bus station (金沙东站) on Jinsha Road (金沙路), but I don’t think it’s that great.  Usually they are easy to spot because they have wooden fronts and are plastered in red decoration. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overseas post</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/overseas-post.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ho hum so what has happened recently. This weekend, aside from bad stuff happening to me, was basically one long ex-pat party. Bad stuff first. Bloody customs. I ordered some books from England that have been sent wrong anyway, but now they’re stuck in Shenzhen customs and the form I need to get them into China proper, no one can find. Joy, oh joy. I can’t send them back because Fed-Ex will charge me another 130gbp, this is not good. I am praying that the lad from Fed-Ex who has taken pity on me and said they won’t charge me a holding fee, has the power to make his promise real.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   We have finally worked out why it is a problem.  They were sent by express delivery, which is automatically classed as commerical property.  It should have been sent by normal airmail.  We are waiting on the grace of Shenzhen customs but not holding out too much hope, they have rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Moral of the story:  When having things sent from overseas, make sure it’s cheap, or sent slowly.  And make sure it gets sent to Shantou proper.  Argh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beer/tea gardens</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/beertea-gardens.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Declined the last Thursday night invitation to Sunglow and just went for tea in the &lt;strong&gt;Bud&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;beer garden behind the Golden Gulf&lt;/strong&gt;. Also had a slightly surreal expedition to look for a small lad that hangs around Jinsha Lu, an enlightening and thought-provoking experience. There is more than one world in Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point, however, is the beer/tea garden. It’s, well, behind the Golden Gulf, near Sunglow and Walmart. Jinsha Lu (金沙路). I like it because it’s chilled. There are lots of places to drink tea in Shantou, and most of them sell beer too. They aren’t loud. There’s another good one on Jinhu Lu (金湖路) and Baihua Lu (白花路) crossroads, in the Jinhu Dasha (金湖大厦). That’s on the second floor, it has a live piano in the evenings, and a barbeque downstairs. It’s pretty cool!  Neither of these is too expensive, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My quest for good beer/tea places is going to become more serious as winter heads on in, because you can’t sit at a bbq place on the roadside in winter, it’s too cold. The clubs are not a place to chill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zero</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/zero.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Then there was Friday. It was planned down for a quiet night in, but I txted Yizhi some friends to say hi, and then went to 老地方-Lao3 Di4fang1- (Old Place) for JDcoke. That was nice, nothing crazy, but then a tkd friend called, to Zero (零点 Ling2 Dian3), and Zero always turns into the most mental of nights out, I don’t know what it is about the place. Crazy night with friend and old schoolmates - whiskey and green tea or tonic water, drinking games, were the most prominent features. When I got home I drank some milk and water which tipped my poor stomach over the edge and I threw up for the next 14hrs, this has not happened in many years I wonder if it was dodgy whiskey. ugh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;老地方 Lao Difang/Old Place, along with Channel 5 (第五频道) nearby, are probably two of the only places in Shantou that sell alcohol in a chilled out atmosphere, the closest thing there is to a pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;零点 Ling Dian/Zero, part of the ‘triangle’ just off Jinsha Lu, opposite the Golden Gulf hotel.  Extremely loud, but good fun for a party, if you don’t need to talk much.  There is also an upstairs with couches and space to dance, should you so wish, but need more money (spend 200rmb minimum).  The area also has LA, locally extremely popular, Evergreen, Kiss and MP3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Windsurfing and posh Chaoshan food</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/windsurfing-and-posh-chaoshan-food.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sunday had gan mian (Round Door rest.) lunch with Yen. Afternoon - &lt;strong&gt;windsurfing&lt;/strong&gt;! Can you believe it! Windsurfing in Shantou! But they have it. It’s on Da Hao. I reckon it’d cost about 50rmb in a taxi. I don’t know the setup but there are boards and things - it’s all in a little hut by a calm (and clean) bay. Don’t know if it’s an insider thing or what, can’t be, they’re out to make money after all. I liked that they had proper showers with doors on. Foot hurt a bit, still not very strong from breaking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/15/68223640_d688c2a5a8_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/34/68219518_0e9919c4a6_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   In the evening I went to &lt;strong&gt;Mei Yuan&lt;/strong&gt; with my friend, her cousin +husband and kid. Her cousin is my age argh she’s married with a 13month old child. They’re here to leave the kid in Shantou because they both have to work where they live, in Dongguang. Harsh eh? Harsh but necessary. At least he’ll get looked after by caring relatives. Of course the kid didn’t have a clue what was about to happen, being so young. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;美？Mei3Yuan2 top range seafood restaurant that specialises in Chaoshan food.  But it’s really excellent food.  I always get taken there for special meals with school or friends’ families.  They have a couple in Shenzhen too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taiwan tea and street kids</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/taiwan-tea-and-street-kids.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a manic weekend. I think my life is getting back to normal after broken foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started on Friday. I was having a nice quiet evening - oh no, it started on Thur. On Thur I went out for &lt;strong&gt;Taiwan tea&lt;/strong&gt; with my friend Bill. I managed to pay for him which is an achievement coz he usually wants to pay. That was nice, because that day I had met lots of &lt;strong&gt;street kids&lt;/strong&gt; and it was on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The street kids are professional beggars of a sort - I’m still trying to get to the bottom of it. The most shocking thing to me is not that they exist but that no one considers them people. We were in my friend’s car on Jinsha Road when I saw a couple and said hello, one ran over to show me something but he was adamant you shouldn’t open the window. I did anyway coz he wasn’t going to ask for money - it set off a convo that lasted a long time. My friend said there are kids trained to hypnotise so you’ll give them your stuff. I dunno. They’re still kids. What is interesting is when you ask anyone here what you should do to help people, they all say: Get rich and then you can set up a foundation like Bill Gates. It is really a fantastic idea that only the rich can help other people who they don’t personally know. Maybe it is the stage of development - people still struggle to make themselves secure. But I don’t know. Brazil has lots of people who aren’t rich, doing good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan tea&lt;/strong&gt; - it’s milky and flavoured and it’s got little black jelly-like balls in the bottom, it’s nice.  You get it at most of the tea houses I think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep sea fish and ginger miracle cure</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/deep-sea-fish-and-ginger-miracle-cure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sat night was a halloween party, but I wasn’t feeling well due to night before so this coloured my perception of the whole night. Yen was down from his work, which was good, and around two o’clock am he finally took me to this fish place he’s been talking about for ages. It’s called 深海鱼-shen1hai3yu2 (deep sea fish), and it’s on chang ping lu. Excellent. And we asked for a pile of ginger to be stuffed in the middle of the pot, and ginger is a miracle cure for all digestive issues (well, things that involve throwing up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s expensive, 30rmb for a pot, although it makes a full meal.  Really good.  Only open at night though.  Yen says the reason it’s so expensive is that the mainland Chinese fishermen don’t have the technology to catch it so they have to buy it from Taiwanese and Japanese.  Mmm is good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Church</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/church.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to church. Twice in one week. There are big churches in Shantou, 1 Catholic and 3 protestant that I know of. There’s also one of each in Chaozhou. It’s a popular religion. The people were nice - the usual church kind of people. They really like praying, which is good. They also like visiting sick people. For me some of the praying is a bit wordy but I guess that’s just personal perference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mon evening there’s a youth service - well actually it just means a normal service for me, jus it’s run by young professionals. I think Sunday services are incredibly traditional - I can’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wed evening seems to be choir prayer group, but I have elbowed my way in anyway and it’s good, I wish there was more Bible study, that’s really why I’ve gone back to church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Church here doesn’t seem much different from Britain, the US, or Brazil. Should it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The church I’ve been to is on Waima Lu  外马路-wai4ma3lu4.  There are three there, 1 on it’s own, an old elementary school, and two next to each other, one of which is the Catholic one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Round Door restaurant</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/round-door-restaurant.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to a nice place yesterday, it’s called the Round Door. It’s what’s called a dry-noodle restaurant. You order a bowl of noodles that has satay sauce and meat on it, and soup for the side (6, 8 or 10rmb’s worth, more money more stuff in soup). Then randomly choose dim sum because the menu’s all in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a nice manager who speaks some English. My favourite dim sum are the little pumpkins (小金瓜 xiao3jin1gua1), anything with with shrimp, and the bread (馒头 man4tou2). It’s about 15rmb/head including dim sum, there are two restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classy one’s at the end of Changping Road (长平路) , past the bridge. The original is nearly the other end of Changping Road, not far from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dansuao - Yen&quot;s hot spring</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/dansuao-yens-hot-spring.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday I went to my friend Yen’s hot spring resort, actually it’s not his, it’s his friend’s, but hey whatever.  It’s called Dansuao Hotspring Resort and it’s in the countryside between Shantou, Chaozhou and Jieyang.  I met Yen in an internet cafe in November last year when he was trying to read my e-mails.  He was here helping his friend build the resort from well, scratch, when I went up to have a look it was just a big building site.  I like the story behind the resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yen’s from Singapore, as is his friend Mark.  They’re both 3rd generation Chinese immigrants. Mark’s grandad is from the village next to where the resort now is, in fact he has a road named after him because he emigrated to Singapore, became ridiculously rich, and contributed lots to his home town (this seems to be the tradition among Chinese expats). He bought a piece of land next to the village which just happened to have a hot spring underneath it. He then bequeathed said land to son and grandson and got them to promise to develop it for the general good of the area. Which is what they have done - well, Mark’s the one who lives there and does everything - the resort itself is totally luxurious, health-orientated, the like, and expensive at that, so this brings trade and employment to the local villages. The target market is the three sounding towns/cities, but others always welcome, they plan to have Japanese and Hong Kongers come through sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to the resort a few times over the past year but this was the first time to go in the water, there are about 100 little pools altogether all with different temperatures. It was really quite coz it was Monday daytime so everyone was at work and it’s only just opened anyway. They give you a cup of water and fold your towel every time you go to a new pool if they can find you. The top one is really hot, 39 degrees. They say the water is good for your skin, well mine and my friend Jonny’s scabs all fell off and scars looked nicer, it was very clever. Did you know they empty all the pools every night and fill them every morning. That’s a lot of water. Yen says they don’t pump it up, they just take the natural flow, this way it stays sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenery I also really love, there are mountains (well, hills) and it’s nice clean air and just really Relaxing and chilled out. The hotel is nice too but pricey, everything is new and the staff fall over themselves to be nice, even if they get confused a lot. I especially like the hill behind the hot spring, there’s a piece of history on top, a Japanese artillery post from the Japanese occupation. It covered all the surroundig countryside, must have been a big gun. I wonder what life was like back then. Yeah so it’s nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;？山湖温泉度假村：潮安东山湖（515642) Dansuao Hotspring Resort: Chaoan, Dongshanhu (515642) Dansuao wen1quan2 du4jia4cun1: chao2an1, dong1shan1hu2 Phone: 0768-5215888 (lines open 15.00-01.00) www.dansuao.com Resort is open 10am-2am daily. The easiest way to get there is a 50rmb taxi (negotiate), but you can also catch the bus to Chaozhou (10rmb) and tell them to let you off at Jin1shi2 (金石). This is a lonly-looking junction but 3-wheeled-motorbike men will appear and it costs about 15rmb to the resort. Bumpy but interesting coz it’s the local area. Hot spring, massage (full body and foot), Chinese and Western restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZhongXin, snacks &amp; Chaozhou</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/things-to-do-in-shantou.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;General advice from four of my wonderful daytime students:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.Shantou has a lot of snacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are very delicious. If the person who came to Shantou never tried the snacks, that would be a pity! In Shantou, there are a lot of food streets.You can try all of the food there. For example, you can try ‘hao luo’. ‘Hao2luo4’ (蚝烙） is a stir-fry with medusa, eggs, and shrimps. If you don’t like it, don’t worry, you can eat ‘wu mi guo’ (无米果). It’s polished with a kind of vegetable. If you want to eat more full, you can choose ‘chang fen’ (肠粉). There are two kinds of this food, one is beef and one is pork. Oh! I can only say the food is fantastic. There are lots and lots of different foods in Shantou, you really need to try them. (If you want to know where the food streets are, please leave a message. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.In summer, swimming is a good way to make you feel cool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to go swimming, I will introduce you to a good place, that’s Zhong Xin Du Jia Cun (中信度假村). The place is near the sea, and there is also a swimming pool, so you can decide whether to play in the sea or swim in the pool. If you play until late, don’t worry, there are lots of cottages, you can stay there and eat in the hotel there. Exactly, that is a good place in summer! A taxi costs about 30 yuan (元) each way. You can also catch the number 10 bus, and the last one to leave ZhongXin is at 6pm. It takes about 45min.  You take the bus from Zhong1lv3 or Dong1xia4 Bus Stations (中旅车站or东厦车站). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Shantou ( including Chaozhou 潮州). Something special you may do or see in Shantou If you like some adventure, you might go to ZhongShan Road (中山路) to watch a motorbike competition at 1:00-4-00 in the morning!! &lt;em&gt;(NB from Maggie: This is both dangerous and illegal!)&lt;/em&gt; Although I’ve never been there before, I’ve a good place to recommend you to go where Shantou people love to relax at night!! It’s called L.A. Bar (洛城), and is a bar/club just off JinSha Road (金沙路). Chaozhou ‘s musical fountains are very famous in China!! It has a water show when the public holidays are on. Also, Chaozhou has a street which is for eating called Xiaochi Street (小吃路) (You can eat all the Chao Shan’s local food there!!) However, Chaozhou isn’t only an eating city, it is also famous for pottery and porcelain. So you could go to THE CENTRE OF POTTERY to see different kinds of pottery!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ice cream and Walmart</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/ice-cream-and-walmart.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I went for ice cream in Shantou - wow, ice cream in Shantou, they don’t even have fresh milk here. Well, it was with a group of mostly foreigners so the standards were quite high, and it didn’t really match up, but the two scoops of chocolate was worth 14rmb I think. &lt;br /&gt;
 Anyway for anyone who feels they must eat ice cream, I give you the address below. It’s just off LinBaiXin Square. &lt;br /&gt;
Apollo(阿波罗)中信海滨花园西？A19&lt;br /&gt;
0754-8940138&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB Actually you Can get fresh milk in Shantou, Walmart sells it in the fridge section. We reckon the pale blue is semi-skimmed, dark blue full (or extra) cream, and red is rank - skimmed. &lt;br /&gt;
 Walmart also sells French sticks (but they’re not crispy), olive oil, Heinz baked beans, mayonaise, peanut butter, kelloggs cornflakes and pasta tomato sauce - original, meat or garlic options. &lt;br /&gt;
 What else ‘foreign’ does Walmart sell?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Karaoke</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/karaoke.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to ktv last night. It was good fun. We’d gone out for seafood then (as usual with this group of friends) went off to ktv. My parents are visiting so this was their first time to ktv hehe they weren’t impressed with their own singing but they really liked the setup. I think specially funny was my friend’s friend who got incredibly drunk, stuck an orchid behind his ear, and individually introduced practically the entire staff of the ktv to my parents as his big/little brother or sister. They also learnt how to play the dice game, played everywhere round here where alcohol is drunk. One of the biggest pasttimes in Shantou is karoke, more commonly known as ‘ktv’ - this being a good thing because you don’t need Chinese to be understood. Karoke here is nothing as it is known to the West. Here there’s no embarassing standing up in front of a big crowd, oh no, here you hire your own room and have a private party. Oh yeah, you might not be used to ktv. You hire a room size according to how many people you’ve got - I’ve been with just two friends before, or you can get rooms that seat 30 people up. Then order your snacks and drinks, work out how to choose songs, and go for it. Good Place KTV has Bacardi Breezers woohoo the only place in Shantou with alcopops. I love ktv mainly coz you don’t need to sing in tune. Go with your friends and have a competition, how many songs can you ruin. Local people are often great singers (I think!) but the tone deaf ones are equally enthusiastic when with friends. And after a drink. It’s so different from the normal British attitude to singing, and what’s more you get your own room to have a party in. It’s great. There are lots of ktv places around, some older some newer. A lot of them you have girls to ‘accompany’ you, if that’s what you want - I don’t. The two biggest, best value, and have the widest and most modern selection of songs (inc English lang) are Good Place (好地方, Hao3Di4Fang1) on Chang Ping Road长平路 outside Walmart, and Happy Day (欢乐地, Huan4Le-Di4) on the corner of Jinsha Road金沙东路 and Huashan Road 华山南路. They also have no girls for hire. These two places battle it out for business so there’s lots of offers on and although night time (spec weekends) can be expensive, daytime is usually really cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bag snatchers</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/bag-snatchers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahh… I’m a little bit depressed today coz my parents are here and I can’t take them anywhere. Also my friend Jonny has just arrived for the travelling we’d planned before I broke my foot. Also tomorrow my other friend Jess and her friend Nana arrive instead of us going to Yunnan. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather is in the high twenties, maybe into thirties, and tomorrow is National Day (1st October) - this country is hot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it should be known that Shantou’s a really safe place to live and hang around in except for if you have a bag. There’s a really big problem at the moment with bag snatchers on scooters - and they’re good, I know someone who got her bumbag snatched two nights ago (the third time she’s been snatched from!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can walk around late at night, you don’t have to worry about abductions or murder or even face-to-face muggings with knives, not even burglarly. Women can walk around at night and have no worries, and there’s no significant problem with drunken violence. We don’t even have pickpockets. But we do have those bag snatchers on bikes and my word are there a lot at the moment. My friend is a policeman in this department and often calls after having just spent 30 hrs (with no sleep?!) catching a bag snatcher and processing the necessary documents and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They come from outside Shantou and are either drug addicts or (mostly, I think) people with no job and no money. There’s no social security here. Local people are utterly unforgiving and think it paints a really bad image onto their city, which I suppose it does - but it’s really the only crime they have (aside from some gang activity in some clubs) - the only crime that affects the public. I just want people to be aware and know about it but also know that it’s literally the only criminal danger you have to beware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point: carry supermarket plastic bags or a rucksack on both shoulders!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little Bee restaurant</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/little-bee-restaurant.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right one of the best things about Shantou is the food so while I’ve broken my foot and can’t go out anywhere I’ll just write about where to buy food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice restaurant is called ‘小密锋’ （xiao3 mi4 feng1) or ‘Little Bee’. It’s just behind Jinsha Road (金砂东路, jin1sha3dong1lu4) and just off Huashan Road (华山南路, hua2shan1nan2lu4) near the centre of town. I know it coz it’s almost outside my school and it’s cheap and great food. You can get fried rice or noodles for about 5元, or beef and black pepper sauce (+ rice) - 8元, or if you eat in you can have loads of dishes. Unfortunately there isn’t an English menu so you need a Chinese speaker or the willingness to walk around and point at other people’s food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phone number: 8463913&lt;br /&gt;
Address: 汕头市丹霞庄北区10幢&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese medicine</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/chinese-medicine.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/24/58880097_ce5ee3199b_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Arghh bad things have befallen me, I broke my foot at taekwondo on Sunday. I’m not going to talk about taekwondo at this sec as it’s kind of a bad advert but let me stress that it was NOT while doing a specific tkd move, I just stepped back and my foot went under me and, well, broke. Since then I’ve been discovering the joys of Chinese medicine, in many ways much better than the Western stuff, mainly because it makes you get better so damn quick but you do have to drink some really disgusting stuff that I’m not sure adds to the speed, it’s the physiotherapy that does miracles (they don’t use plaster casts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Anyway I’ve got hardly any access to a computer even though have lots of time to think, so apologies. Also should say here that my friends and school are fantastic and have been visiting me lots and getting me anything I need, I feel well looked after which is good, coz I live on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Muslim noodle restaurant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/12/68220534_6c27a97a10_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;There is a little street next to Walmart which I call Walmart street. Very close to the bright red internet bar about half way down is a ‘la mian’ restaurant. It looks nothing but you should try the food, it’s excellent and known throughout Shantou. ‘La mian’ means ‘stretched noodles’ - you can watch them being made at the entrance. They are a Muslim family from the north-west of China and have recently expanded into the neighbouring shop. Menu in Chinese but one of the lads knows English words for basic ingredients such as dumplings and noodles, and they’re really friendly. The bread and pulled noodles are particularly noted. And it’s extremely cheap. And I’ve never got ill after eating there.&lt;/p&gt;

Richard asked me to help him coz he lives in England at the mo so doesn’t get many up-to-the-mintute experiences of here, and wanted someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who know me: we are looking for contributors so if you have anything to say, e-mail it over and I’ll stick it on and give you credit, if you often have things to say we’ll make you your own id. Also this includes pictures you might wish to share with the world. If your thoughts don’t fit in an existing category we just make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t written so publicly before so it’ll be interesting writing for a completely open audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hi from Richard @ MyShantou.net</title>
      <link>https://myshantou.net/hello-world.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/30/44584167_c060487dfe_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to MyShantou.net!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Hong Feng (洪峰) but you can call me Richard. I am studying in Durham University, UK. I was born and grew up in Shantou, so I can say I am a 99.8% local Shantounese! Well, 0.2% was lost, or say influenced, in my life of studying oversea in the last three years. And that 0.2%, is the main reason why I want to create this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was studying and traveling abroad, I’ve been to quite a few countries and visited their famous cities. But every time when I am back to Shantou for holiday and compare my hometown to those cities, I feel there is really a long way for Shantou to be a modernized city. Shantou is one of five special economic zones of China, however, its recent development doesn’t seem be qualified to be a highly developed economic zone. I feel I need to do something for it as a local Shantounese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a blog may be a good idea, but why it’s in English? Well, this should be referred to my experience of traveling and my foreigner friends here. I often check out the information on the Internet when planning a trip to somewhere. But when my classmates from England came down to visit me this summer, I couldn’t really find any websites in English that provide them information about Shantou. For the same reasons, I have some foreign friends who are working or living in Shantou, but quite often I heard them complaining about there is little information to help them living here. So I hope making a blog might be a good idea for them and for those who wants to visit Shantou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is not going to run by myself. My friend Maggie is the other admin (Blogger) of this blog. I knew her when I was a volunteer at an English school last summer. She has been living in Shantou for more than 1 year and going to spend one more here. She told me she loves Shantou, and as a local here, I am very happy to hear that :-). But I just want to say that this blog is not going to be run by only two of us either, we need, and are hoping, more people can come and join us! Not matter whether you come here for a short visit or have been living here for a long time, we will be very happy if you can share your experiences and your point of view about Shantou with us. We will give out user IDs for you to log in and write by yourself easily if you want to be a regular blogger of MyShantou.net, otherwise you can just send your articles or photos to our emails and we will post them here for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, finally I hope you will like this blog and here will be helpful for you. Welcome to Shantou and MyShantou.net!&lt;/p&gt;
