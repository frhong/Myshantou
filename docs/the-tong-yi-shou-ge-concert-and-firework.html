    <div class="post__content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It is not much of a news anymore because the concert and firework were held on 25th and 26th of April. But I think it’s still worth to mention here as these two events were topical lately in Shantou. Even I know about it in UK, well, from my families and news on the net.</p>

<p><strong>Investment Campaign</strong></p>

<p>To begin with, these two majors events are the peeks of recent campaign launched by the government to attract investment in Shantou. As one of the special economic zones and had a high growth in early 1990s, Shantou was famous at the time. But start from late 1990s until now, the economy doesn’t go very well, or I should say the city doesn’t develop as well as it supposes to. There are many reasons for that, which I think might be too lengthy to write down here. However, lately, it seems to be some real actions to aim to revive the concession.</p>

<p><strong>Tong Yi Shou Ge Concert ( TYSG - 同一首歌)</strong></p>

<p>TYSG is a concert held by <a href="http://www.cctv.com/program/tysg/01/index.shtml">CCTV</a>. They invite famous singers to the show and have been held in many major cities in China. It has been quite a lot of noises about why TYSG didn’t come to Shantou, because it’s kind of like a symbol for major city and Shantou should have it.</p>

<p>The concert on 25th was mostly sponsored by <a href="http://www.yihuagroup.com/">Yihua Enterprise Ltd.</a>, which I heard from my dad that it was a company in Chenghai but now grew to be a group corporate and got listed in stock. It went quite well overall, as the news <a href="http://www.google.cn/search?q=%E5%90%8C%E4%B8%80%E9%A6%96%E6%AD%8C+site%3Awww.stnews.com.cn&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">said</a>, but there are <a href="http://www.ezeem.com/forum/read.asp?id=1584&amp;no=10443964">critiques</a> in some online forums as well. I can’t give any comment because I didn’t see it. But personally I am still happy to know the concert come to Shantou.</p>

<p><strong>The Firework</strong></p>

<p>There were 160 thousands firework in the sky of Shantou and lasted for one hour on the 26th. It must be phenomenal, I wished I could be there. The firework was sponsored by Xinda GPS, which I don’t know exactly what it is but <a href="http://www.gd.chinamobile.com/st/business/xdyw.html">looks like</a> part of China Mobile.</p>

<p>I am sincerely happy to see any development, or even just some campaigns like that, in Shantou. The city is not doing as well as it suppose to, as I said. Hopefully efforts like that will bring Shantou a better performance.</p>
