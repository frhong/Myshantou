Earthwalker Stops in Shantou Enroute to Beijing

Spreading an environmental and peace message, earthwalker Paul Coleman and his wife Konomi Kikuchi arrived in Shantou on November 9th from Hong Kong by foot, according to local newspaper Shantou Special Zone Evening. They planted ten trees at the Jinping Industrial Zone with officers from the Shantou Forestry Department.

They started this journey from Hong Kong on September 22th, 2007. They plan to walk to Beijing on the eve of the 2008 Olympics.

Paul said on his blog that his goal was to encourage the planting of 100,000,000 trees for people killed at war, and inspire other people to action for environmental preservation. He also said he had planted around 10,000,000 trees in at least 35 nations.
