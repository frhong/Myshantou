Just got an email from my dad sharing this 3D Shantou Map website [http://xz.st.gd.cn/](http://xz.st.gd.cn/). I have to say it's pretty cool and will certain provide a lot of conveniences to tourists from other cities. I don't think there is a English version yet and I doubt it will have one in a short term.
