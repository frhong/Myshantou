The local authority implemented a traffic control on large trucks in the North District, the city centre of Shantou according to the Shantou Daily.

The new policy, which began Saturday, is aimed at easing downtown traffic and abating noise from trucks.

Under the order, all large trucks are banned from entering some main roads like Jin'xin Road, and banned from some other roads during rush hour.
