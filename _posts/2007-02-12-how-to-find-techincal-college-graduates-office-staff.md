I have to say this the technical school my centre is part of, but as people are often looking for office workers versed in foreign trade regulations, this is the name and contact details of the lady in charge of placing appropriate students in companies that come looking.  I do not know if it is often successful or anything, but it is a service some people might find useful, and you could also try other technical schools (zhong zhuan), but I don't know their names.
