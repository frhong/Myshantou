I was on the bus (route 2) two days ago and the boy next to me cut my pocket open with a knife and stole my mp3 player!  The cheek of it!  I only discovered just as he'd got off the bus. 

And about 20min before that a young boy about 13 yrs old had tried to pickpocket me.  I'd read about it in the local newspaper so when he veered off and joined two men and another boy, I knew he was definitely a thief.  Honestly, I give up.  I'm not buying nice things any more.
