Last night there were 9 of us so we were sat in a big room with 9 chairs. They're big armchairs, it's great. Actually usually I don't enthuse about them as much as other foreigners do, but last night cured my foot.  

Also common are hair washes at hairdressers' - that includes a head and neck massage, you don't have to get your hair cut (usually 20rmb). 

Where are good places? The one I go to most is just behind Jinsha Road 金沙东路 (near Jinsha Dong bus station 金沙东站), just off Huashan Road 华山南路 (can you tell I live in this area?), next to Little Bee restaurant (小蜜蜂).  It's on the second floor, from the street it's just an open door with a staircase.  (Address n nuo. see below)

For hair washing, there's a hairdresser's just near it on Huashan Road called Avant-Courier, that's ok.  My personal favourite is United Star (联星) on Changping Road (长平路), the massage there is always great, never too scratchy. They must train their staff well.
