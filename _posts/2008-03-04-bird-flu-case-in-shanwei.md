An H5N1 related case was discovered on February 25th in Shanwei, a city to the south of Shantou. The patient, a 44 year-old woman from Sichuan province, died as a result of the disease. She had worked at a brick factory in Haifeng County, Shanwei City. A report found that she had been with dead poultry before her clinical symptoms emerged. Thus far, no reports of similar symptoms among people who had been close to the patient before the death have emerged.
