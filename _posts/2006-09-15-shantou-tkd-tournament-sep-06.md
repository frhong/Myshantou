Tkd tournament on Sunday 17th!  In Shantou, Dongxia Sportsground, Baihua Rd.  新力量跆拳道，东夏运动场，百花路  Morning and aft.  I'm an umpire, which stresses me out slightly as was presented with the rules and requirements on Monday and after spending one afternoon being taught the basics moves, two afternoons at the tkd place (道管) with the wonderful Kit (小猫) helping me read the rules and reqs, and one afternoon mocking fighting and fouling, I still don't think quick enough to look like I know what I'm doing when I judge whether it's a warning or a right out foul.  Arghhh
