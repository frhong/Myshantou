I am not impressed by the Shenshan Expressway (深汕高速公路), it is no longer very express.  It took me over 9 hours from Guangzhou to Shantou yesterday, where it usually takes 5 1/2.  It was crawling all the way down.  A tip for our transport managers: MAKE THE RAILWAY DIRECT, AND PUT MORE TRAINS ON.  Grr.

I don't want to hear any excuses about it being nearly New Year.  In a few years it'll be like that every day.
