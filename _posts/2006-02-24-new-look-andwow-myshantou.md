I have updated the blog to the [latest version](http://wordpress.org/download/). And tonight I spent a bit time to look for a new template for it. Finally chose [Vslider](http://irui.ac/cool-stuff/vslider) which looks quite cool to me, hope it will be bring a new feeling to our readers and visitors as well.

Also, I found some photos which I took before and some of them are from friends. After editing them into header image (as you can see above), I realised 'Wow, Shantou is actually a very nice city!'. Surprised I just found my hometown is such a beautiful place after born and lived there for 17 years! It's really ‘My Shantou’! Just press 'F5' in your keyboard and refresh the page, you will see more nice photos<br>
So, here is our new look :) Hope you like it.
