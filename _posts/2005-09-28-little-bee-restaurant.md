Right one of the best things about Shantou is the food so while I've broken my foot and can't go out anywhere I'll just write about where to buy food. 

A nice restaurant is called '小密锋' （xiao3 mi4 feng1) or 'Little Bee'. It's just behind Jinsha Road (金砂东路, jin1sha3dong1lu4) and just off Huashan Road (华山南路, hua2shan1nan2lu4) near the centre of town. I know it coz it's almost outside my school and it's cheap and great food. You can get fried rice or noodles for about 5元, or beef and black pepper sauce (+ rice) - 8元, or if you eat in you can have loads of dishes. Unfortunately there isn't an English menu so you need a Chinese speaker or the willingness to walk around and point at other people's food.
