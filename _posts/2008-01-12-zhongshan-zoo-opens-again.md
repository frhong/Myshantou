The zoo in Zhongshan Park will open again this month, after having been nearly doubled in size. Elephants, zebras and hippos have been added to the animal collection.

Built in 1954, it was the only zoo in east of Guangdong. There used to be over 40 kinds of animals in it in the 1970s. But it was so small that fewer and fewer visitors came. The zoo could not afford to raise animals and to buy new ones. 

Renovation of the zoo started on July 20, 2007. Cooperating with an animal training team from Henan province, the zoo put 6 million yuan into this project. The size of it was extended from 6500 square meters to 11000 square meters. New cages and stages were also built. A number of new animals such as elephants, zebras and hippos will be on display. \[According to an article from Shantou Special Zone Evening [here](http://www.dahuawang.com/localnews/showlocal.asp?no=98062).\]
