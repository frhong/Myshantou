A funny advert on Youtube (via [istel.info](http://istef.info/)), but the man is speaking Chaoshan dialect!!! Even the fire fighters people shout in Chaoshan dialect. I wonder why this company named [Centraal Behee](http://www.centraalbeheer.nl/) in Apeldoorn use Chaoshan dialect in the ad but not Mandarin?
