Went on a boat trip last night. It was a friend's surprise birthday party and her boyfriend hired a small boat to drive up and down the river while we partied on it. So thoughtful!

Actually you don't have to hire your own boat, there's a bigger one that leaves 9/9.30pm and does the same loop (up to one bridge, down to the other and back to port). I've been on it before, it gives a nice nighttime view of the city waterfront. I think it's about 50rmb? Richard'll know, he went on it last year.

Don't take your own snacks though, they'll get annoyed!

Leaves from Lundu(轮渡), next to the ferry to Queshi, opposite the swimming pool. On Haibin Road (海滨路) All drivers know it.
