Just a quick notice. Maggie and I will be in the BBC "[Have you say](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/default.stm)" programme about [Chinese New Year](http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?threadID=5533&&&edition=2&ttl=20070215180539). I've [blogged this](http://www.richardhong.com/2007/02/15/happy-chinese-new-year-at-bbc.html) in my blog. It will be fun to watch it (or listen). 

How is the new year atmosphere out there in Shantou? There are a lot of things going on among postgraduate colleges here in Durham. Enjoy!!
