Walked around the city's People's Square (Ren Ming Square) for the first time ever last night. I usually hang around Linbaixin Square, the one opposite Walmart, because it's near my house and anyway it's got grass, but last night was passing through the older part of town so we stopped to chill and look at the musical fountain. Chaozhou beats Shantou hands down for fountains, gotta say that! But the Chaozhou musical fountains are really quite famous (and very big) and it's probably unfair to compare. The Shantou one is nice enough for an evening stroll. Big plus is it's on Haibin Lu, next to the ferry terminal, and there's a swimming pool there too (summer only, are you crazy wanting to swim in winter).
