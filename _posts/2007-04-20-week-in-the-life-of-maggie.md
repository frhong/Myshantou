Despite not being able to write about the following things, it has been an interesting and eventful week:<br>
Two (unconnected) friends close to suicide (not so fun)<br>
A fist fight<br>
A crazy English school (not mine though!)<br>
Great life changing news of one friend

Unfortunately they are either about issues that we can't talk about here, or stories that I shouldn't, because the people are still around, and Shantou is small. Two of each! Leave you to guess which is which.
