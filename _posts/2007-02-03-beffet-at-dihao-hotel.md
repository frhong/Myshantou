One must-do thing whenever I go back to Shantou is to have a buffet lunch at [Dihao (帝豪 - Regency) Hotel](http://www.regencyhotelshantou.com/). It cost about 90 yuan per person for lunch, and 120 something for dinner (they may charge additional service fee). So I only go to lunch :) But if you go for dinner there will be more stuff and nicer food I guess.

One piece of advice here: take their sushi and oyster. Normally I didn't have main course but only eat their sushi and oyster, they are so nice!

Share some pictures here. I want to go back again!!
