Went to the Meritus for Afternoon Tea on Sat afternoon.  It was interesting - obviously not as classic as in England - no scones, no sandwiches - but as well as cakes with REAL CHOCOLATE they also had fresh salad and some hot (well, kept-warm) snacks.  Tea was extra, I had hot water.  Then they tried to charge 5rmb for the water!  But they took it off again.

As it was buffet style, 25rmb, I ate a lot, and it did for my dinner too.

The residents' bar/lounge is possibly one of the nicest bits of the Meritus, and you don't need to be a resident to go in it.
