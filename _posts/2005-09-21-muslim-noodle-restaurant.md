![](http://static.flickr.com/12/68220534_6c27a97a10_m.jpg)There is a little street next to Walmart which I call Walmart street. Very close to the bright red internet bar about half way down is a 'la mian' restaurant. It looks nothing but you should try the food, it's excellent and known throughout Shantou. 'La mian' means 'stretched noodles' - you can watch them being made at the entrance. They are a Muslim family from the north-west of China and have recently expanded into the neighbouring shop. Menu in Chinese but one of the lads knows English words for basic ingredients such as dumplings and noodles, and they're really friendly. The bread and pulled noodles are particularly noted. And it's extremely cheap. And I've never got ill after eating there.
