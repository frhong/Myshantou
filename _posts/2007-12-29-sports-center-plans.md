A Sports Park and a Sports Center were planned in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, a circular that outlines economic and social development every five years from 1953.

According to the plan, a Sports Park will be built on east of Songshan Road in town. It covers an area of about 260,000 square meters and includes football field and running track. At the same time, a Sports Center will be built near the Swimming and Diving Stadium in south of the city, with an indoor stadium that can contain 10000 people. \[according to an article from Shantou City Daily [here](http://www.dahuawang.com/localnews/showlocal.asp?no=97668)\]<br>
