Shantou's toy industry has begun feeling the pinch of the international economic crisis, reports said.

Shantou is the largest toy-maker in Guangdong province and workers said many of the companies are struggling to stay afloat.

At a toy exhibition held on Oct. 9th in Shanghai, the staff at some toy manufacturing companies said a few companies were beginning to expand domestic sales to ride over the downturn in international demand.
