Hello everyone, I'm on holiday in Singapore, and Richard suggested I should blog about it because a lot of our readers are actually in Singapore. I will sing nothing but praises for the country/city of Singapore, I've only been here 2 1/2 days so I won't allow myself to make sweeping statements but... what an amazing place! How did it take me so long to get here?! Why doesn't Everyone want to move here! Yeah. Fully approve of this country.
