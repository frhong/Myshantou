![](http://static.flickr.com/31/45051113_ce9c84f3b8.jpg) Right, I'm Maggie, an English teacher in Shantou, and I actually like it. Richard asked me to help him coz he lives in England at the mo so doesn't get many up-to-the-mintute experiences of here, and wanted someone who does.

People who know me: we are looking for contributors so if you have anything to say, e-mail it over and I'll stick it on and give you credit, if you often have things to say we'll make you your own id. Also this includes pictures you might wish to share with the world. If your thoughts don't fit in an existing category we just make a new one.

I haven't written so publicly before so it'll be interesting writing for a completely open audience.
