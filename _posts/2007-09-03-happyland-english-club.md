I received a comment in our blog a while ago from the one of organisers of a local English Club called "HappyLand". I was quite interested and I replied in email and asked for more information about this club. Here is the introduction.



> Happyland English Club,a nonprofit organization based in Shantou, founded on May 15, 2004, which was organized by English enthusiasts. Happyland English Club is aiming at creating a rich English talking environment for all English enthusiasts. "Practise in English and talk in English". Through the efforts of all members, the club now holds activities weekly and has more than two hundred members from various industries.



They also have a blog [here](http://hi.baidu.com/sthappyland).

I definitely want to attend one of their events when I'm back, if there is one by then. It's a great way to bridge up foreigners and locals. From my personal experiences, the best way to make friends with local people in a foreign land is to start with those who are interested in your own culture. So I hung out with Chinese-learners or those who are interested in Chinese culture when I first went to the UK. Then I did the same when I went to Japan. It's the best way to get started. So if want to explore the city and make local friends, maybe that's the place to start with.
