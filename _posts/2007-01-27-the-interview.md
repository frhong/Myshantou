Finally managed to convert the interview and upload it here.

To be honest we were originally wanted to say about this blog, but after meeting us with us, they were very much impressive by Maggie's Chinese and decided to move the angle to her. We didn't want to lose such good PR opportunity, so we took it. However Maggie tried to talk more about the blog through the interview. After that she told me she was surprised that the media here could make the report the way you want.

Anyway, thanks for the TV people! Here is the video. The one below is in Tudou so it's faster to view in China. If you are not in China, here is the view [in Yahoo](http://uk.video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=937972676a5a1669b978d42648c28058.1750009&vback=Studio&vdone=http%3A%2F%2Fuk.video.yahoo.com%2Fvideo%2Fstudio%3Fei%3DUTF-8) which might be quicker for you. But of course, you can also download it from here:<br>
