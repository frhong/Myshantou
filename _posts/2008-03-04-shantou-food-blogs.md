Two new links have appeared in the links column of this webpage, [Have You Eaten Yet?](http://media.stu.edu.cn/diane/) and a [Food Writing Class blog](http://media.stu.edu.cn/jou4390/). Both blogs are all about food in Shantou.

Shantou is renowned for its Chaoshan cuisine, but the blogs go into all aspects of eating in Shantou -- recent posts discuss everything from Sichuan hotpot to Brazilian barbecue (in Shantou?!! Yes, who woulda thunk it?).

Word has it that China Daily will do a feature article on the blogs and English food writing in Shantou, so connoisseurs of the delicious should keep their eyes peeled for that.
