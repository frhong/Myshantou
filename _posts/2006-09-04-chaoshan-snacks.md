Hey so we got our new teachers (nearly lost one, but he was bright enough to make his own way into town). Last week we took them for a quick tour of town, and went to a pretty famous Chaoshan snacks place, photos beneath. The main thing to remember is that it looks like fat but it's NOT, it's rice. 

Address: 金凤坛再过去一点 Jinfengtan, a bit past.

The snacks we ate: haoguew豪果，五果汤，无米果
