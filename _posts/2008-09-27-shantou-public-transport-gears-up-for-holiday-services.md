Shantou is all geared up for handling the peak travel rush expected as people celebrate the national holiday (from September 29 to October 5). Shantou's local media reports on Sep. 26 said officials estimated that bus stations would be transporting over 30,000 passengers during the holiday week.

The peak in short distance travel would take place from Sep 29 to Oct 1 while the long-distance travelers are expected to travel mainly on Sep 29, Oct 4 and Oct 5. Local officials expect high passenger flows during these days. The number of long-distance passengers headed to the south-eastern coastal cities is also expected to increase.
