Mai Huang, a disabled boy from Chaozhou, is now cycling around the country in 220 days to promote the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, according to Shantou Daily [here](http://www.dahuawang.com/strb/20071206/gb/strb%5E3049%5E4%5ESt060004.htm). 

Mai was injured in his lower back at the age of sixteen. The injury affected the nerves in his legs. He was not able to run or jump again. He fell in love with cycling in 2004 and found hopes in his life in it. He started planning his journey early in 2008.

"My dream is to cycle around China to promote the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games,” Mai said to the Shantou Daily five years after he was injured. 

He found two sponsors who provided him a bike and a tent. He also sought help through the Internet. 

On December 3rd 2007, Mai started from Shantou on his bicycle. He arrived in Guangzhou recently. According to his plan [here](http://maif19.blog.163.com/blog/static/56767391200711112505298/ ), he will go to Sichuan through Hainan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chongqing and come back to Shantou in the first 130 days. Then he would head north through Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong and Hebei and Beijing. The whole journey is about 17000 kilometers long.
