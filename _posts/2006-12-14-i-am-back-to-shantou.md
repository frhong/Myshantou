It’s nice to be back home. I just arrived in Shantou this morning from Hong Kong. I will be staying for one month until 14th of January. While I’m here, I will try to keep myself updating this blog on daily bases. 

First note today, it surprises me a lot that the temperature is around 22C here. When I left England three days ago it was around 1~5C there, and now I’m like having a English summer again in the middle of December, amazing! 

I’m still in my jetlag now and better catch some sleep now. Hopefully some interesting posts will start tomorrow.
