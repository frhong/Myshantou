Chenghai, a Shantou satellite community and industrial area, has established a cooperative operation with CCTV to produce toys based on CCTV cartoons, according to an agreement reached on February 28th.

As a famous toy production base and one of the most important export cities in China, Chenghai gained the designation “Chinese Toy City” in 2003. Companies have been encouraged to strengthen ties with cartoon makers from all over the world, said the Chenghai government. Chenghai was chosen as the partner because it has stable toy industries and paid lots of attention to toy creation and brand, said the related-project manager of the CCTV cartoon limited company. 

For promoting their cooperation, the Chenghai government will devote eighteen million yuan as special funds to support the cartoon industry.
