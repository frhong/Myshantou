After meeting with [Bob](http://fm100.yo2.cn/) and [Emma](http://blog.sina.com.cn/observerluyy) - two students from Shantou University Journalism School who are currently contributors of [News.MyShantoun.net](http://news.myshantou.net) - when I was in Shantou, I was excited and happy that this project can be continued after [John](http://the-bitter-melon.blogspot.com/) left for American. One thing I like about working with university students is that they are passionate and enthusiastic on what they are doing. But more importantly, being involved in such a project is beneficial to both the blog and also their journalism practices. I'm sure John will be happy to see his students continue this project after he left.

Bob just dropped me an email that the news team asking for more volunteer to join. Here is the [main page](http://news.myshantou.net/356.html). If you are currently in Shantou, please feel free to contact them and be part of the team.
