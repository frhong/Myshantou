I should've written earlier, but I actually visited Shantou in January (08!) for a week - a whirlwind of meals and visits and one night of hard drinking. It was for my friend Henry's wedding. I never actually made it to the wedding - had to get back up north the same day - but I spent time with him and his wife (Ella), and saw all my friends and ex-colleagues! No really great pics or stories, just old friends meeting up and being happy. Although we did unearth a cafe which I'll write about.

Henry, me, Ella. Congratulations! And they're going to have a baby, too!
