I have several pieces of art that I've been planning to get framed for up to two years, and since I moved into my new flat they have been in a pile doing nothing. My friend suggested a shop. They sell art, but also frame stuff for you and come and hang it up, which is what they've been helping me do, so very cool! They don't even charge to come and drill holes in my wall, not sure if that's usual or special for me. Their shop is opposite Jinsha dong bus station (金沙东车站), on the ground floor of Jindu Yuan Building (金都园大厦).

I also happen to know their nephew, who is a black belt at tkd, which just goes to show how small Shantou is.
