The Chaoshan Bonsai and Rare Stone Exhibition organized by Shantou, Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shanwei in eastern Guangdong opened at the Shantou Garden Hotel on October 1. This exhibition displaying 386 bonsais --miniaturized trees -- and 262 rare stones will remain open until October 10.

The sub-tropical Chaoshan climate is conducive to plant growth and suited to growing miniaturized trees. Rare stones are an essential part of the bonsais.

Among the exhibits here are some that have even won prizes in various competitions.
