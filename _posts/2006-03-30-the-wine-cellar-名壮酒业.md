Was on my bike the other day and I came across a new wine bar, it's called the Wine Cellar, it's on the tree-lined avenue near LA Bar - the one between that collection of bars and Jinhuan Road.  The one that leads to Channel Five and Old Place bars. 

The selection is wider than Aussino - more countries (Italy, France, S.Africa, California, Australia main ones I remember), and I don't think as expensive. 

Lovely girl on the till.
