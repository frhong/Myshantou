Well it has happened now, I did write a draft on it then the draft disappeared - it was a draft coz the site wasn't working properly in Shantou - I shall still post the notification, just so people know such events exist:

 On 27 January there was a concert of classical music, some Chinese, some western - played on combinations of piano and erhu.  I would've liked to go, because I am utterly starved of live music , but it was not possible. 

It took place in the Linbaixin Exhibition Centre, front seat tickets were 180/120rmb and back seat ticket were 80/50rmb. 

Would've been nice!  My piano teacher told me about it.
