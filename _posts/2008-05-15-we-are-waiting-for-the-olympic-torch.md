The torches were carried by 208 torchbearers most of whom were born in Shantou and have made great contributions to either local or national athletics. The runners included a weightlifting coach and champion, six world diving champions and other outstanding citizens from Shantou.

Both streets that the torches were expected to pass by or streets nearby the route were crowded with people turning out for the Olympic torch. Some of them were from Chaozhou, a city next to Shantou, as well as representatives of other towns around Shantou. Some of them arrived at their spots along the route in the early morning. Although it rained most of the time during the torch relay, a man exclaimed , "The rain can not extinguish our passion!"after the torch passed the Lin Baixin Times Square.
