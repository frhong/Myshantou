Five coaches from Shantou were selected to participate in the Beijing Olympics. Three of them are sailing coaches from Shantou Sports School, including Chen Wenbo, Yu Yanyan and Du Ruojia. The other two are Huang Miaohua who teaches swimming and Chen Huayi who teaches shooting. It’s predicted that more coaches from Shantou will play a role in the Olympics before it is held. \[According to an article from Shantou City Daily [here](http://www.dahuawang.com/localnews/showlocal.asp?no=98106)\]
