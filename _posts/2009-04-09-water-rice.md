#### Water Rice

(By Huang Xiao Qing)Lai Han Sheng, a farmer from Lai Cuo Villiage in Shantou, is transplanting his rice seedlings alone into his wet rice field on the afternoon of March 22, 2009. "Farming is not the only source of livelihood for the villagers. It can't make a good living. The young, therefore, prefer to raise goose or work outside the village rather than farm," he said. According to the local farmers, a total of 350-500kg rice can be produced from each mu of land, earning between 700 to 1000RMB. However, the rice fields demand hard work. To water their fields, they need to pump water from the river. They use fertilizers as well and don't have enough money to pay for machines.
