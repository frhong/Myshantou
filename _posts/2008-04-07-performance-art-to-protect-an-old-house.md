Hand in hand, forming a big word "NO,"40 young people gathered in front of Xiangyuan House and used performance art to protect the old house from tearing down.

Xiangyuan House is a European style building in the old section of the city. It was built as a personal house during the period of the Republic of China (1921-1949), and became public property in 1949. Now it is a kindergarten under the threat of being demolished.

The activity to protect it was organized online by an activist with the nickname "Exploring Frog."
