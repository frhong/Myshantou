A ceremony celebrating the maiden voyage of the Shantou port-Mediterranean international container liner route was held at Guang'ao harbor on March, 7, 2008.

The sea route is a true international container route, which will increase local imports and exports, enhance the capacity of Shantou port, and even contribute to the Shantou economy, according to the report.

The international container liner route links 12 sea ports from 8 countries, which are Shanghai(China), Pusan (South Korea), Shantou (China), Kelang (Malaysia), Damietta (Egypt), Naples (Italy), the Rijeka (The Republic of Croatia)and Koper (The Republic of Slovenia).

The first voyage of this route was carried out by the "Orchid" of the CMA CGM Shipping Company from France, a 222.1 meter vessel. The total tonnage of "Orchid" is 39,000 tons and with 2,800-TEU container vessels on the ship. (TEU, Twenty foot Equivalent Units, express a measurement in the shipping industry; a common container size is twenty feet in length, eight feet high, and six feet in length.)

The CMA CGM Shipping Company has plans to launch other international container liner routes between Shantou and the Mediterranean Sea. The volume of goods is expected to rise to 200,000 TEUs annually in total.
