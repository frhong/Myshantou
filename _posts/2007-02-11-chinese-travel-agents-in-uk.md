There is a travel agent in Manchester that is also in Milton Keynes, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Paris, Beijing and Shanghai. They are a Chinese travel agent - I think Richard has [talked about](http://www.richardhong.com/2006/10/26/flight-ticket-to-china.html) this type of travel agent on his own blog - but if you are travelling to China and NOT going to Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong, I really recommend you fly with them. They are set up so they can get you to cities in China for a reasonable price, ie £450 return, Manchester - Shantou, changing in Beijing. Now that is as it should be. They guarantee lowest fares.
