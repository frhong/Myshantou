I received an email from Amy who is from the U.S. but currently return to Shantou. Amy, I hope you won't mind if I post your email here.

> This time I brought with me the hopes of many little American children. A hope to be friends with Chinese kids, particularly those living in poverty. So I brought with me school supplies, picture books and a fierce desire to find some schools willing to begin lasting relationships with schools in the US. This is more than just a little donation; it's about kids forming relationships in this globalized world, we adults just facilitate that. This is the idea of Kids to Kids international [www.ktki.org.](http://www.ktki.org)

Coincidentally the email came on the same that I attended John Wood's talk in my company. For those of you don't know John Wood, you can read about him on [here](http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1029) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/Leaving-Microsoft-Change-World-Entrepreneurs/dp/006112107X), or watch a video [here](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6zX2O3pQia4). I very much admire his motivate and his belief to make the world a better place through education and help to our next generation that really needs help. Although I wouldn't consider Shantou is a city in poverty, there are still some areas that are lack of basic education. Thanks Amy for bringing the books to Shantou and also let me know about this project. I agree that it's "more than just a little donation; it's about kids forming relationships in this globalized world". I left Shantou when I was 18 to see the world, and I know exactly what she meant by this.

So here is my part of contribution in this blog. I will also write a post in Ezeem forum in Chinese to see if there are some local schools or charity bodies that are willing to help with this project.
