According to the People’s Daily, a Chaoshan airport project plan was passed on Oct 23, 2007, meaning that a new airport in Chaoshan will be built in the future. The recent Shantou Airport in the town of Waisha will be replaced after the new airport is built. 

The Chaoshan Airport is located in Jiedong county in Jieyang city, which is the center of Chaoshan. Jiedong is 20 kilometers away from the downtown of Shantou, Jieyang and Chaozhou. <br>
According to the provincial newspaper Nanfang Daily, the government is planning to invest an about 3.8 billion RMB in this new airport and finish the project in 2020.
