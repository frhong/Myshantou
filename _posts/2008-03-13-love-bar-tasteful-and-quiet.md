Very well done cafe/tea house/bar, quiet but not boring, balcony with a sea view, a design company owns it (I think!) - it shares the premises! So the design is tasteful, and not tacky. Unfortunately I didn't get a picture and we never got around to going back. Hopefully it won't go out of business if it has the support of the design company! Jiayou quiet bars in Shantou!

If you know him, it's in the same building as Lam's architect company.
