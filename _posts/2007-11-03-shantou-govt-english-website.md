I know it may be hard to believe, but it does indeed appear that the local Shantou government has an official website in English.

You can find it here: www.shantou.gov.cn/en/main.asp 

Of particular interest I thought was the "Investment Project" link on the lefthand sidebar -- it lays out a variety of different projects in the works or underway. (My favorite is "Robot Noopy for software learning.")

Unfortunately, the "Investment News" section doesn't seem to have been updated in the last few years.
