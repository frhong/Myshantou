I feel I should say hi just coz it's been so long since writing something. It's the summer holidays, which means everyone that offers any kind of classes if offering overtime, and anyone who doesn't have to work is going to classes, and sometimes if they work too.

So... I'm busy - and the internet has been down for a week and a half at school (grr). Daytime English, nighttime tkd and also I have a life to keep up!

Hmm... Went for seafood last Sunday. Outou 澳头 (ao4 tou2). It's in a place just outside Shantou called Dahao 达壕 (da2 hao2), which is really the countryside - swimming, hills, fresh air. Unfortunately you need a car, but the seafood is excellent. In Dahao there's a place called Outou, which has a row of seafood restaurants. I always get taken to the same one, the one at the end of the row - don't let those lads standing in the middle of the row steer you in to park, they just want you to eat at theirs (which could well be good, who knows).

Wow, my friend sure ordered a lot. A wide selection of shellfish that you scrape/suck/pick out of shells, snails, crab - raw and fried, green veg, several Chaoshan snacks, a couple of fish and don't forget the soup. All for 9 people. Delicious. She said it wasn't very well cooked, but it was good enough for me. And not a sign of bad stomach - very fresh.

I'm sorry I'm rubbish at directions on roads. Ask a local, or even better take someone who knows with you. 澳头.

The following pictures were taken by my friend's daughters (who also count as friends!), taken together you can get an idea of the place where you order... food wasn't their aim in these photos...
