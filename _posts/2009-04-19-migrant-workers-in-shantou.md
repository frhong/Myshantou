The rural population in China is about one billion. They contribute a lot to China's development, but enjoy fewer privileges compared to people who live in cities. Their life, income, medical care and education are still worse. In order to have a better life, most of them choose to work in cities. They mostly do hard jobs which the city people feel ashamed to do, and they save as much money as they can to bring back home.
