Over a hundred business people, experts and scholars from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao came together at the 7th Nanao Forum in Shantou on September 28-29. The two-day forum discussed the possibility of establishing direct transport connections from Shantou to the neighboring islands for enhancing economic cooperation.

The forum was established in 2002 and its annual meetings have helped Shantou businesses to meet their counterparts from the neighboring islands. The forum has been a basis for increased cooperation between Taiwan and Shantou businesses.

The number of Shantou companies with Taiwanese investment has reached 579 and data for the first half of 2008 show that the total investment has reached US$163 million. These industries produce electronics, garments, food products and construction material among others.
