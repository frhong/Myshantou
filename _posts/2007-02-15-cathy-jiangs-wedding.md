Congratulations to my ex-workmate and good friend, Cathy Jiang, for her wedding on 18 Dec 2006! They live in Beijing now but came back for the ceremony. In the photo they are playing games inflicted on them by the host of the meal - usually the best man or a professional entertainer take on this role.
