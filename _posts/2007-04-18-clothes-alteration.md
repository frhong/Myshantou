I would like to sing praises of the small things in life in this post. Namely that I can get people to mend and alter my clothes for me. I Can sew, should the need arise, but professionals do it so much better. Opposite my school in a little alley are two such shops, one of which now knows me quite well, because I get through buttons, zips and pocket seams like a small child. <br>
Recently I ventured into letting them alter my clothes that were made for fatter people than me, the test was a success so I went crazy and handed over five more at once. Going to get them tomorrow, hope they haven't cut them too small. 

You could never do that in the UK. The joys of China. Makes my clothes last so much longer.
