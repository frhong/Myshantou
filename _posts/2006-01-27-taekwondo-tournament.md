Oh had the Shantou taekwondo tournament, it wasn't as big as the Guangzhou one of course but it was still good. What to say? People fought taekwondo in the morning, and in the afternoon as well. Some people won and some people didn't. I love taekwondo, and it's also quite satisfying to kick someone in the head, not sure if that's a good thing though.
