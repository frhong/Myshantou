The New Spirit Film Festival will begin tomorrow at Shantou University and run through December 1st.

Thirteen independ films will be screened at the Science Lecture Hall starting from tomorrow, Tuesday Nov 27th. Three directors, two American and one Chinese, will be present to discuss their work and run workshops. 

The Chinese director is Zhang Jia Rui, whose work includes "When Ruoma Was Seventeen," a film about the coming of age of Yunnan minority girl. (A rather poingnant synopsis is here at IMDB:<br>

The American directors are Jay Craven and David Boyle. Craven is the son of well-known horror film director Wes Craven. Boyle's film "Big Dreams Little Tokyo" might be described as "Napoleon Dynamite" meets "Lost in Translation." Craven's film "Disappearances" chronicles the adventures of a Vermont farmer turned bootleg whiskey runner and stars Kris Kristofferson.

More info and a schedule of showings are available from a link on the J-school homepage, here:
