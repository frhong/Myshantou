Yeah, another excuse to write about taekwondo (tkd)! 

On 22 January 2006, the Shantou Taekwondo Association will be holding the Shantou winter taekwondo tournament. Categories: children, teenagers, adults. Split by weight and belt. Time and address coming as soon as I know it.

Wahey! Are you fighting? Are you watching? I'm fighting (assuming I don't hurt myself in the Guangzhou competition this weekend). See you there!
