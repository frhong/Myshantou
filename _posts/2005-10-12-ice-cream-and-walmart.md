Last night I went for ice cream in Shantou - wow, ice cream in Shantou, they don't even have fresh milk here. Well, it was with a group of mostly foreigners so the standards were quite high, and it didn't really match up, but the two scoops of chocolate was worth 14rmb I think. <br>
 Anyway for anyone who feels they must eat ice cream, I give you the address below. It's just off LinBaiXin Square. <br>
Apollo(阿波罗)中信海滨花园西？A19<br>
0754-8940138

NB Actually you Can get fresh milk in Shantou, Walmart sells it in the fridge section. We reckon the pale blue is semi-skimmed, dark blue full (or extra) cream, and red is rank - skimmed. <br>
 Walmart also sells French sticks (but they're not crispy), olive oil, Heinz baked beans, mayonaise, peanut butter, kelloggs cornflakes and pasta tomato sauce - original, meat or garlic options. <br>
 What else 'foreign' does Walmart sell?
