Just got some photos from my parents. These were taken in Changping Road on the 20th April. Shantou was flooded within a few hours after a heavy rain. My dad complained about the drainage system and said it needs to be improved.

As summer is almost here, Shantou is going to enter a typhoon season. But scene like this is still rare.
