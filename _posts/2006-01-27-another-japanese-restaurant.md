My friend Bill is moving to Australia with his family after New Year so last night he took me out for dinner to say goodbye and we went to a Japanese restaurant. That makes five that I know of in Shantou and there still isn't a single Korean restaurant. Entrepreuneurs in the catering industry: OPEN A KOREAN RESTAURANT IN SHANTOU. People often tell me their favourite foreign food is Korean yet Shantou has not a single restaurant, what are you all doing. 

Anyway, it was very nice actually. It wasn't insanely expensive like Narita, but more expensive than the one on Changping Lu with the girl outside. Actually it's next-door-but-one to that very restaurant. Second floor, quiet, nice service, but they charge you 2元 for red tea, cheapskates.
