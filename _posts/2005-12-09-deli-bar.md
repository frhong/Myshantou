Went to Deli bar (De Li) bar last night, also known as The Beer Bar because it's the only place in Shantou that sells its own-brewed beer.  They sell it by the jug.  It's quite inconspicuous - on the second floor opposite Pizza Hut on Jinsha Lu.  It's also one of the few places in Shantou where you can drink in a bar-like environment without ridiculously loud music.  I don't think I've written about it...

The entrance is just stairs leading up.  At the top turn left and then you're inside. 

Jinsha Dong Lu (金沙东路), at the crossroads for Walking Street (Bu Xing Jie 步行街).  Pizza Hut and Mc D's opposite.  Coming from the Golden Gulf, and the Meritus, it's the crossroads after YiDu cinema.
