This namecard has been with me since 2005, just never got round to writing it up. If you want to earn money you should go to Shantou (preferably Chenghai) but if you want culture, go to Chaozhou, which has 1000 yrs of history. 

Chaozhou has several special products, one being porcelain (瓷器), another being embroidery (刺绣). This is the address of a good embroidery shop that sells tablecloths and smaller things like handkerchiefs, and also bookmarks made of skeleton leaves, very pretty.
