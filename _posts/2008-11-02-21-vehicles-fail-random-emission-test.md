Twenty one percent of motor vehicles tested for emission on Wednesday failed the pollution test.

The test was carried out by the Traffic Control and Environmental Protection Departments which carried out random checks on 33 vehicles of which seven emitted more pollutants that what is considered acceptable.

Increased emissions from an ever increasing number of motor vehicles is said to be a major source of pollution in Shantou.
